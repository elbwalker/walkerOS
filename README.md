# Why walkerOS?

- **Full data ownership**: Your data stays yours. No vendor lock-in, no third-party dependencies, complete control over how data is captured, processed and shared.
- **Scalable tagging**: DOM-based, component-level frontend tagging makes tracking declarative, reusable, and easy to maintain.
- **Privacy-first by design**: Built-in consent handling and privacy controls help you meet compliance from day one.
- **Tag management as code**: Replace complex UIs with clean, version-controlled tracking logic.


## Packages overview

- **Collectors**: ([docs](https://www.elbwalker.com/docs/collectors/),
  [code](./packages/collectors/)): For client- or server-side data collection.
- **Sources** ([docs](https://www.elbwalker.com/docs/sources/)): For data creation and state management.
- **Destinations** ([docs](https://www.elbwalker.com/docs/destinations/),
  [code](./packages/destinations/)): Initialize, map and share events to
  third-party tools.
