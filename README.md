## ü§ì Usage

You can implement all sorts of front-end user events from e-commerce actions like product add to carts, product usage events, and UX events like visible elements, scrolling, etc. using the walker.

Just set a few HTML attributes

```html
<!-- General usage -->
<div elb="ENTITY" elb-ENTITY="KEY:VALUE" elb-action="TRIGGER:ACTION" />
```

The result is for example something like this:

```js
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'product add', // combination of entity and action
  data: {
    // all set properties with the elb-product attribute
    name: 'Everyday Ruck Snack',
    price: 220,
  },
  globals: {
    // all set properties with the elbglobals attribute
    language: 'en',
    test: 'darkmode',
  },
  user: {
    // a stored random id in the cookie (manually added once)
    device: 'cookieid',
  },
  nested: [], // all nested entities within the product
  id: '1647968113641-b4b9h9-5', // timestamp, group & count of the event
  trigger: 'click', // name of the trigger that fired
  entity: 'product', // entity name
  action: 'add', // entity action
  timestamp: 1647968113641, // time when the event fired
  timing: 13.37, // how long it took from the page load to trigger the event
  group: 'b4b9h9', // random group id for all events on a page
  count: 2, // incremental counter of the events on a page
  walker: true, // flag to filter events
});
```

All you need to get started are the entity, action & trigger attributes. You define the entity scope by setting the `elb` attribute with the name of an entity to an element, e.g. `elb="product"`.
An action can be added by setting the `elb-action` attribute on the same level or all child elements in combination with a matching trigger, e.g. `elb-action="click:add"` to fire a <strong> product add </strong> event when a user clicks on the tagged element.
To define the entities' properties, set the composited attribute `elb-ENTITY` with the name and value, e.g. `elb-product="name:Everyday Ruck Snack;price:220"`.

```html
<div elb="product" elb-product="name:Everyday Ruck Snack;price:220">
  <button elbaction="click:add">Add to cart</button>
</div>
```

### Triggers

By using the walker.js you don't have to deal with event listener or mutation observer initialization anymore. The walker comes with a bunch of integrated triggers that will fire your event at the right moment.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Trigger</th>
    <th>Definiton</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>load</td>
    <td>after loading a page when DOM is ready</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>click</td>
    <td>when the element or a child is clicked</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>visible</td>
    <td>after the element has been in viewport for at least 50% for one second</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>submit</td>
    <td>on a valid form submission</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>custom</td>
    <td>calling elbLayer.push()</td>
  </tr>
</table>
