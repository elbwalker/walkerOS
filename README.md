# walker.js

Walker.js is an open-source event tracker. Easy, standardized & flexible. With walker.js you can capture user events in the browser and send them to any destination - just by setting HTML attributes.
Become independent from locked-in analytics systems and set up reliable tracking the moment you design your front-end.

## ü§ì Usage

You can implement all sorts of front-end user events easily with walker.js. From product and UX events like "newsletter signup", or filter usage, etc. to e-commerce actions like product add to carts or order complete events. The walker.js handles all [trigger initializations](#-triggers) and race conditions, builds the [events with context](#-usage) and distributes them based on [consent states](#-consent) and [mapping definitions](#destination-configuration) to any [destinations](#-destinations).

Start by just set a few HTML attributes

```html
<!-- Generic usage -->
<div
  data-elb="ENTITY"
  data-elb-ENTITY="KEY:VALUE"
  data-elbaction="TRIGGER:ACTION"
/>

<!-- Example usage -->
<div
  data-elb="article"
  data-elb-article="name:Seting up tracking easily;category:analytics"
  data-elbaction="load:view"
/>
```

The result is for example something like this:

```js
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'article view', // combination of entity and action
  data: {
    // arbitrary set properties with the data-elb-article attribute
    name: 'Seting up tracking easily',
    category: 'analytics',
  },
  globals: {
    // all set properties with the data-elbglobals attribute
    // Not shown in example usage snippet (data-elbglobals="language:en;test:darkmode")
    language: 'en',
    test: 'darkmode',
  },
  user: {
    // stored user ids (manually added once)
    id: 'userid',
    device: 'cookieid',
  },
  nested: [], // all nested entities within the article
  id: '1647968113641-01b5e2-5', // timestamp, group & count of the event
  trigger: 'load', // name of the trigger that fired
  entity: 'article', // entity name
  action: 'view', // entity action
  timestamp: 1647968113641, // time when the event fired
  timing: 3.14, // how long it took from the page load to trigger the event
  group: '01b5e2', // random group id for all events on a page
  count: 2, // incremental counter of the events on a page
  version: {
    // Helpful when working with raw data
    walker: 1.5, // used walker.js version
    config: 42, // a custom configuration version number
  },
  walker: true, // flag to filter events
});
```

You are completely free to define naming conventions. All you need to get started are the **entity, action & trigger attributes**. Learn more about the elbwalker [event model](https://www.elbwalker.com/blog/elbwalker-event-concept) and background in our [blog](https://www.elbwalker.com/blog/).

1. You define the entity scope by setting the `data-elb` attribute with the name of an entity to an element, e.g. `data-elb="article"`.
2. An action can be added by setting the `data-elbaction` attribute on the same level or all child elements in combination with a matching trigger, e.g. `data-elbaction="click:signup"` to fire a _article view_ event when a user clicks on the tagged element.
3. (Optional) To define the entities' properties, set the composited attribute `data-elb-ENTITY` with the name and value, e.g. `data-elb-article="name:Seting up tracking easily;category:analytics"`.

```html
<body data-elbglobals="language:en;test:darkmode">
  <div data-elb="article" data-elbaction="load:view">
    <h1 data-elb-article="name:Seting up tracking easily">
      Seting up tracking easily
    </h1>
    <p data-elb-article="category:analytics">Analytics</p>
  </div>
</body>
```

`data-elb`, `data-elbaction` and `data-elbglobals` are reserved attributes whereas `data-elb-` attributes may be arbitrary combinations based on the related entity name.
Actions and properties can be set anywhere inside an `elb` attribute.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Add the walker.js to your website and start tagging. Optionally you can specify destinations.

### Installation

Either use the walker.js via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elbwalker/walker.js) as a project dependency

```sh
npm i @elbwalker/walker.js --save
```

```ts
import Elbwalker from '@elbwalker/walker.js';
const elbwalker = Elbwalker({});
```

Or as a script

```html
<script
  class="elbwalker"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@elbwalker/walker.js@1.5/dist/walker.js"
></script>
```

> Note: Loading from external ressources is not recommended for production mode. You should always host it by your own in terms of GDPR.

### üé¨ Triggers

By using the walker.js you don't have to deal with event listener or mutation observer initialization anymore. The walker comes with a bunch of integrated triggers that will fire your event at the right moment.

```html
<!-- The trigger will fire the "entity action" event -->
<b data-elb="entity" data-elbaction="TRIGGER:action">...</b>
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Trigger</th>
    <th>Definition</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>load</td>
    <td>after loading a page when DOM is ready</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>click</td>
    <td>when the element or a child is clicked</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>visible</td>
    <td>after the element has been in viewport for at least 50% for one second</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>hover</td>
    <td>each time the mouse enters the corresponding element</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>submit</td>
    <td>on a valid form submission</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pulse(ms)</td>
    <td>recurring trigger every _ms_ seconds (15 sec by default) if page is not hidden</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>wait(ms)</td>
    <td>waits _ms_ seconds (15 sec by default) until triggering</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>custom</td>
    <td>calling elbLayer.push()</td>
  </tr>
</table>

_To see how triggers are used with different components, please refer to the exemplary usage in our [Template Gallery](https://www.elbwalker.com/gallery)._

### üéØ Destinations

By default all events get pushed into the `dataLayer`, but you can customize the destinations. Walker.js is extensible and supports multiple destinations at once.

Example of adding a GA4 destination:

```sh
npm i @elbwalker/destination-web-google-ga4 --save
```

```js
import GA4Destination from '@elbwalker/destination-web-google-ga4'; // Load the destination
GA4Destination.config.measurementId = 'G-XXXXXXX'; // Set all required properties
elbwalker.push('walker destination', GA4Destination); // Add the destination
```

A destination has a `config` object and a `push` function. The optional `init` function will only get called if available and as long as `config.init !== true`. It's meant to load external scripts or configure mandatory fields required for all following events. If you don't want the build-in `init` function to get called, set `config.init = true` before adding it. Note that no events will be processed as long as the `init` functions return anything other than true.

#### Destination configuration:

```js
// Typed as WebDestination.Function
const ExampleDestination = {
  // Interface where each events is sent to
  // (usually a bit more complex than here)
  push: console.log,
  // All global settings are optional
  // Each destination might add new fields
  config: {
    // Required consent setting to receive events
    consent: {
      // List all required consent states
      // At least one needs to be true to pass
      marketing: true,
      exampleDestination: true,
    },
    // Protected object for customized handling
    custom: {
      // anything you want and need
    },
    // Current state of initialization
    init: false,
    // Individual event handling
    mapping: {
      // Each destination can have its own Event Mapping definitions
      entity: { action: {} }, // Basic mapping structure
      article: { view: {}, read: {} }, // Handling article events
      // Matching all events
      '*': {
        '*': {
          // Example value of a custom mapping for unspecified events
          custom: { logUnknown: true },
        },
      },
    },
    // Additional settings depending on the destinations definitions
  },
};

elbwalker.push('walker destination', ExampleDestination);
```

_See more examples, learn how to customize, or write your own in the [destinations deep dive](./destinations/)_.

### üîê Consent

You can define required consent states for each destination individually. With each event the consent states gets checked. The walker.js handles the race conditions. If there is no required consent yet, the event will be added to an ordered queue. The queue is reset with each `walker run` command. And will be processed with each `walker consent` update.

Typically a Consent Management Platform (CMP) handles the consent. This is an asynchronous process. To set/change the consent state, the CMP should push one command with the permission state (true/false) of a group or an individual tool. If only one condition applies, consent is granted. Updating only one value won't override others.

```js
elbwalker.push('walker consent', { marketing: true });
```

You are free to define consent keys (typically known as _functional_, _statistics_, _marketing_). But you can also use individual names for each vendor. The key has to match with the key used in each `destination.config.consent`. To revoke consent and stop sharing events with a destination set all matching rules to false, `elbwalker.push('walker consent', { marketing: false });`.
