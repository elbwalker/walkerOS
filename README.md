# walker.js

Walker.js is an open-source event tracker. Easy, standardized & flexible. With walker.js you can capture user events in the browser and send them to any destination - just by setting HTML attributes.
Become independent from locked-in analytics systems and set up reliable tracking the moment you design your front-end.

## ü§ì Usage

You can implement all sorts of front-end user events easily with walker.js. From product and UX events like "newsletter signup", or filter usage, etc. to e-commerce actions like product add to carts or order complete events.

Just set a few HTML attributes

```html
<!-- Generic usage -->
<div
  data-elb="ENTITY"
  data-elb-ENTITY="KEY:VALUE"
  data-elbaction="TRIGGER:ACTION"
/>

<!-- Example usage -->
<div
  data-elb="article"
  data-elb-article="name:Seting up tracking easily;category:analytics"
  data-elbaction="load:view"
/>
```

The result is for example something like this:

```js
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'article view', // combination of entity and action
  data: {
    // arbitrary set properties with the data-elb-article attribute
    name: 'Seting up tracking easily',
    category: 'analytics',
  },
  globals: {
    // all set properties with the data-elbglobals attribute
    // Not shown in example usage snippet (data-elbglobals="language:en;test:darkmode")
    language: 'en',
    test: 'darkmode',
  },
  user: {
    // stored user ids (manually added once)
    id: 'userid',
    device: 'cookieid',
  },
  nested: [], // all nested entities within the article
  id: '1647968113641-01b5e2-5', // timestamp, group & count of the event
  trigger: 'load', // name of the trigger that fired
  entity: 'article', // entity name
  action: 'view', // entity action
  timestamp: 1647968113641, // time when the event fired
  timing: 3.14, // how long it took from the page load to trigger the event
  group: '01b5e2', // random group id for all events on a page
  count: 2, // incremental counter of the events on a page
  version: {
    // Helpful when working with raw data
    walker: 1.5, // used walker.js version
    config: 42, // a custom configuration version number
  },
  walker: true, // flag to filter events
});
```

You are completely free to define naming conventions. All you need to get started are the **entity, action & trigger attributes**. Learn more about the elbwalker [event model](https://www.elbwalker.com/blog/elbwalker-event-concept) and background in our [blog](https://www.elbwalker.com/blog/).

1. You define the entity scope by setting the `data-elb` attribute with the name of an entity to an element, e.g. `data-elb="article"`.
2. An action can be added by setting the `data-elbaction` attribute on the same level or all child elements in combination with a matching trigger, e.g. `data-elbaction="click:signup"` to fire a _article view_ event when a user clicks on the tagged element.
3. (Optional) To define the entities' properties, set the composited attribute `data-elb-ENTITY` with the name and value, e.g. `data-elb-article="name:Seting up tracking easily;category:analytics"`.

```html
<body data-elbglobals="language:en;test:darkmode">
  <div data-elb="article" data-elbaction="load:view">
    <h1 data-elb-article="name:Seting up tracking easily">
      Seting up tracking easily
    </h1>
    <p data-elb-article="category:analytics">Analytics</p>
  </div>
</body>
```

`data-elb`, `data-elbaction` and `data-elbglobals` are reserved attributes whereas `data-elb-` attributes may be arbitrary combinations based on the related entity name.
Actions and properties can be set anywhere inside an `elb` attribute.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Add the walker.js to your website and start tagging. Optionally you can specify destinations.

### Installation

Either use the walker.js via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elbwalker/walker.js) as a project dependency

```sh
npm i @elbwalker/walker.js --save
```

```ts
import Elbwalker from './walker.js';
const elbwalker = Elbwalker({});
```

Or as a script

```html
<script
  class="elbwalker"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@elbwalker/walker.js@1.5/dist/walker.js"
></script>
```

### üé¨ Triggers

By using the walker.js you don't have to deal with event listener or mutation observer initialization anymore. The walker comes with a bunch of integrated triggers that will fire your event at the right moment.

```html
<!-- The trigger will fire the "app login" event -->
<b data-elb="app" data-elbaction="TRIGGER:login">...</b>
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Trigger</th>
    <th>Definition</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>load</td>
    <td>after loading a page when DOM is ready</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>click</td>
    <td>when the element or a child is clicked</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>visible</td>
    <td>after the element has been in viewport for at least 50% for one second</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>hover</td>
    <td>each time the mouse enters the corresponding element</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>submit</td>
    <td>on a valid form submission</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pulse(ms)</td>
    <td>recurring trigger every _ms_ seconds (15 sec by default) if page is not hidden</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>wait(ms)</td>
    <td>waits _ms_ seconds (15 sec by default) until triggering</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>custom</td>
    <td>calling elbLayer.push()</td>
  </tr>
</table>

_For further inspiration, please refer to the industry examples in our [docs](https://docs.elbwalker.com/examples/ecommerce)._

### üéØ Destinations

By default all events get pushed into the `dataLayer`, but you can customize the destinations. Walker.js is extensible and supports multiple destinations at once.

Example of adding a GA4 destination:

```sh
npm i npm i @elbwalker/destination-web-google-ga4 --save
```

```js
import GA4Destination from '@elbwalker/destination-web-google-ga4'; // Load the destination
GA4Destination.config.measurementId = 'G-XXXXXXX'; // Set all required properties
elbwalker.push('walker destination', GA4Destination); // Add the destination
```

A destination has a `config` object and an optional `init` as well as the `push` function.
As soon as an event triggers the destinations init function gets called once so that all events will get sent to the additional destination now.

_See more examples, learn how to customize, or write your own in the [destinations deep dive](./destinations/)_.
