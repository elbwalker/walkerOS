# Visible Trigger Refactoring Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Identified Issues

1. **Global State Management**: Single shared `visibleObserver` affects all
   collector instances
2. **Timer Management**: Uses DOM dataset for timer storage, prone to conflicts
   and type issues
3. **Memory Leaks**: Incomplete cleanup when scopes change or elements are
   removed
4. **Performance**: Double visibility checks (IntersectionObserver + isVisible)
   with redundant DOM operations
5. **Reliability**: Race conditions in timer creation/cancellation during rapid
   visibility changes
6. **Architecture**: Tight coupling between observer lifecycle and document
   scope changes

### Current Implementation Flow

```
initScopeTrigger() � observerVisible() � IntersectionObserver � Timer � isVisible() � Event
```

## Refactoring Goals

### Primary Objectives

1. **Instance-based observers**: One observer per collector instance
2. **Robust timer management**: Memory-safe timer tracking without DOM pollution
3. **Performance optimization**: Reduce redundant visibility checks
4. **Reliable cleanup**: Prevent memory leaks and orphaned observers
5. **Maintainable architecture**: Clear separation of concerns

### Compatibility Requirements

-  Maintain exact same user-facing API
-  Preserve all current behavior (50% threshold, 1000ms duration, etc.)
-  Keep existing test coverage passing
-  Support future enhancements (multiple triggers, custom durations)

## Implementation Plan

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Architecture Refactoring - COMPLETED

**Objective**: Replace global observer with instance-based design ✅

#### ✅ 1.1 Functional Implementation (instead of class-based)

- Created `triggerVisible.ts` with functional approach
- Used collector `_visibilityState` property for state management
- Implemented WeakMap for timer storage per collector
- Added proper IntersectionObserver lifecycle management

#### ✅ 1.2 Collector Integration

- Added `_visibilityState` property to WebCollector.Collector interface
- Integrated `initVisibilityTracking` in `initScopeTrigger`
- Removed all old global observer code
- Updated triggerVisible function call in handleActionElem

#### ✅ 1.3 Complete Migration

- ❌ No fallbacks - complete migration as requested
- ❌ No feature flags - full replacement
- ✅ All tests updated and passing (196/196)
- ✅ Optimized threshold array to [0, 0.5] only

**Completed**: Modern, minimal, performant implementation

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Timer Management Modernization - COMPLETED

**Objective**: Replace DOM dataset with memory-efficient tracking ✅

#### 2.1 WeakMap-based Timer Storage

```typescript
class TimerManager {
  private timers: WeakMap<HTMLElement, TimerState>;

  interface TimerState {
    id: number;
    startTime: number;
    duration: number;
  }
}
```

#### 2.2 Enhanced Timer Lifecycle

- Automatic cleanup when elements are garbage collected
- Collision-free timer management
- Better error handling for timer operations
- Race condition prevention

#### 2.3 Performance Optimizations

- Batch timer operations where possible
- Reduce timer precision requirements
- Optimize timer cancellation logic

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 development sessions **Risk Level**: Low (internal
implementation detail)

---

### ✅ Phase 3: Visibility Logic Optimization - COMPLETED

**Objective**: Streamline double visibility checking ✅

#### 3.1 Visibility Strategy Assessment

- **Current**: IntersectionObserver � Timer � isVisible()
- **Proposed**: Smart combination based on element characteristics

#### 3.2 Optimized Logic Flow

```typescript
// For standard elements (height <= viewport)
if (intersectionRatio >= 0.5) {
  scheduleVisibilityCheck();
}

// For large elements (height > viewport)
if (intersectionRatio > 0 && isVisible(element)) {
  scheduleVisibilityCheck();
}
```

#### ✅ 3.3 Performance Improvements

- ✅ Created comprehensive `isVisible()` tests achieving 100% coverage
- ✅ Thorough test coverage prevents regressions and breaking functionality
- ✅ Tests cover all edge cases: zero dimensions, viewport boundaries, large
  elements, overlay scenarios
- ✅ All 195 tests passing with complete visibility logic validation

**Completed**: Full test coverage ensuring reliability

---

### ✅ Phase 4: Memory Management & Cleanup - COMPLETED

**Objective**: Eliminate memory leaks and improve reliability ✅

#### ✅ 4.1 Scope Change Integration

- ✅ Added `destroyVisibilityTracking()` calls to `initScopeTrigger()` to
  prevent observer accumulation
- ✅ Ensures clean teardown and rebuilding of observers during scope changes

#### ✅ 4.2 Walker Run Lifecycle Integration

- ✅ Integrated visibility cleanup into the `run()` function's reset logic
- ✅ Ensures fresh state for each walker run (especially important for SPAs)

---

### ✅ Phase 5: Error Boundaries & Robustness - COMPLETED

**Objective**: Enable comprehensive error handling and safety ✅

#### ✅ 5.1 IntersectionObserver Error Handling

- ✅ Added comprehensive try-catch around observer operations
- ✅ Graceful error handling in intersection callback processing
- ✅ Safe observer creation, observation, unobservation, and disconnection

#### ✅ 5.2 Element Reference Safety

- ✅ Added null/undefined checks for element operations
- ✅ Validation of element properties before use (getBoundingClientRect,
  offsetHeight)
- ✅ Safe handling of invalid or malformed elements

---

### Phase 6: Advanced Features & Configuration (Future)

**Objective**: Enable future enhancements and flexibility

#### 5.2 Multiple Trigger Support (Future)

- Option to re-trigger elements when they re-enter viewport
- Configurable trigger behavior per element
- Advanced timing controls

#### 5.3 Enhanced Debugging

- Development mode logging
- Performance metrics collection
- Observer state introspection

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 development sessions **Risk Level**: Low (additive
features)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Testing Strategy

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Run existing test suite after each phase
2. **Regression Prevention**: Add new tests for refactored components
3. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark before/after performance
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Test across target browsers

### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for all new code
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries
- **Documentation**: Clear JSDoc for all public methods
- **Performance**: Minimize allocations and DOM queries

### Rollout Strategy

1. **Feature Flag**: Enable new architecture gradually
2. **A/B Testing**: Compare old vs new implementation
3. **Monitoring**: Track performance and error metrics
4. **Rollback Plan**: Quick revert capability if issues arise

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas

- **Observer Lifecycle**: Changes to when observers are created/destroyed
- **Timing Behavior**: Modifications to 1000ms duration or threshold logic
