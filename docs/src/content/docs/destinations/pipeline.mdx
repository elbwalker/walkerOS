###### How to send events to the Event Pipeline via walker.js

## What is the Event Pipeline?

The Event Pipeline is another product built by elbwalker. It was built to stream your events tracked by walker.js directly to your own <b>BigQuery</b> instance in <b>real-time</b>. It's fully <b>based on AWS</b> and also supports server-side collection. If you're interested in setting up the event pipeline please contact us via the [form](https://www.elbwalker.com/contact/) or schedule a [quick call](https://calendly.com/elb-alexander/30min?month=2023-07) with one of our engineers.
