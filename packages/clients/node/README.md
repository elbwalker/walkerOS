# walkerOS Client Node - Create Server-Side Events

The walkerOS Node Client is designed for server-side applications, offering
robust data handling and processing capabilities within walkerOS.

## What Is The Node Client?

The Node Client operates in the server-side environment of your data
infrastructure, facilitating:

- **Server-side Event Collection**: Collects events from various server-side
  sources.
- **Event Validation**: Validates and ensures data quality and integrity.
- **Data Processing**: Processes and enriches events before they are sent to
  destinations.
- **Consent Management**: Manages and respects user consent, which is crucial for privacy
  compliance.
- **Integration with Stacks**: Seamlessly works with walkerOS Stacks for
  advanced data operations.
