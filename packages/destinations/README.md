# walkerOS Destinations: Sharing events

## Overview

Destinations in walkerOS serve as the final endpoints where your data gets mapped and shared with other tools. They are designed to work seamlessly with their respective clients (node or web).

## Types of Destinations

- [**Node Destinations**](./node/): Specifically designed for server-side applications. These destinations can handle batch processing, data enrichment, validation, and more.
- [**Web Destinations**](./web/): Tailored for client-side applications, these destinations are optimized for real-time data tracking and measuring user interaction in the browser.
