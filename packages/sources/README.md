# walkerOS Sources - Event Collection

The walkerOS sources serve as the **data creation** and **state management**
layer of your walkerOS infrastructure. Whether you're working on a server-side
application with Node.js or a client-side web application, walkerOS sources have
got you covered.

## What Are Sources?

Sources work at the beginning of your data collection journey. They:

- **Event Creation**: Easily create and format user events.
- **State Management**: Maintain user and session states across events.
- **Consent Handling**: Manage user consent states for GDPR compliance.
- **Event Validation**: Ensure the quality of data through event validation.
- **Dynamic Destinations**: Add or remove data destinations dynamically.

A **previous step** is the
[tagging](https://www.elbwalker.com/docs/sources/walkerjs/tagging/) of a page in
the web or [pushing](https://www.elbwalker.com/docs/sources/node#push) in you
app.

The **next step** is to push events to a
[destination](https://www.elbwalker.com/docs/destinations/).
