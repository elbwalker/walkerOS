# walkerOS Stacks - Own Your Data Pipeline

Stacks in walkerOS are pre-configured, ready-to-use APIs that serve as the first
point of contact for your event data. They are designed to work in your own
infrastructure, giving you complete control over data ingestion and processing.

## What Are Stacks?

Stacks are essentially the backbones of your data collection journey. They:

- **Receive Events**: Capture incoming data from clients.
- **Validate Data**: Ensure the data conforms to your specified formats.
- **Process Events**: Enrich, transform, or filter the data as needed.
- **Route Data**: Send the processed data to its final destination.

Stacks are the key to a reliable and efficient data pipeline, ensuring your data
is processed and routed accurately.
