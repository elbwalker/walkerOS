# walkerOS types

This package is designed to be used across all **walkerOS** packages to ensure
consistency and standardization in data structures and communication. It
provides a collection of TypeScript type definitions that are shared among
various walkerOS packages.

- **Consistency**: Centralized type definitions ensure that all packages in the
  walkerOS ecosystem use the same types, reducing the risk of type mismatches
  and errors.
- **Maintainability**: Easier maintenance and updates of type definitions, as
  changes need to be made in one place only.
- **Type Safety**: Leverages TypeScriptâ€™s powerful type system to provide
  compile-time type checking, leading to more robust and reliable code.
