## Company

symgge is a brand of Jean&Len GmbH that was founded in 2013 by Leonard
Diepenbrock. Their cosmetic products are available in over 5,000 branches of dm,
Rossmann, Müller, BUDNI, Tegut, and other retailers. The entire range of
cosmetics and even more beautiful things without Gedøns are available in the
online shop and the Cologne flagship store.

## Challenge

The smygge product team wanted to keep the data collection on
[smygge.com](https://smygge.com/) as lean as possible. They made their
experiences with several tracking plugins and manual implementations but
struggled with duplicates and incorrect tag configurations. They realized they
will save tons of time and nerves in the long run by choosing an event tracking
solution that is quick to implement, works with all their tools and is easy to
maintain.

> We need an event tracking solution that is easy to maintain, works with our
> shop system and analytics stack and eliminates tech bottlenecks.

## Solution

smygge was looking for a solution that unifies and simplifies measurement while
having limited tech resources for tracking topics. As a product manager with
front-end coding experience, Marcel wanted to be able to implement as many
events as possible himself. Now smygge stores all their common behavioral data
from product views, add to carts and transactions as well as business-specific
events like interactions with their product recommendations in their data
warehouse. They are also sending their events to GA4 and GTM for further
reporting possibilities.

> Once you understand the event schema you become so much faster with elbwalker.
> We are very happy with the new workflow we have established for onsite
> tracking. I can implement all the events independently which is what I wanted.

## Results

Adopting elbwalker has helped smygge to speed up onsite tracking massively. The
whole implementation process only took Marcel a few hours instead of weeks. By
building up their source of truth to store and process their owned behavioral
data, smygge feels confident to achieve their growth goals in the future.

> I love the great learning curve you have when you start measuring through the
> walker. You'll only need a short time to dive in and it's so much easier and
> faster than getting developers to push all sorts of information to the
> dataLayer. I am already looking forward to extending our tracking further and
> gathering even more insights about how users interact with our sites.
