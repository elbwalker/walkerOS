We, as well as many other data professionals out there, grew up with still the
most common event out there: **the pageview** - the mother of all tracking
events for over a decade. Over the years new events, mostly to track online
shopping behavior, became the new normal and the concept of the traditional
purchase conversion was born. With the rising importance of mobile apps (where
there is no such thing as a pageview), event tracking evolved immensely. And
today it's not only about online shopping anymore.

**But events and event-based tracking came to stay.**

We believe that tracking shouldn't sound like some abstract techy abbreviation
concept. It should feel natural and **everyone in an organization should
immediately understand it** no matter if they implemented the tracking or not.
Only when everyone understands what is being measured, there will be fewer
misunderstandings, higher data quality, and more actionable data in the
organization at the end of the day.

## Our approach to the concept of an event

A lot of languages are based on some kind of **subject, predicate, object
structure**. It is the general rule for understanding this sentence right here
(which may drove some of us insane at school). At elbwalker, we asked ourselves
how we can evolve a simple pageview to a more natural concept.

Let us introduce: **the page view** (notice the space!). A small change with a
huuuge impact.

Doesn't look very different to you? Well, let us explain why it is.

Tracking starts with a user interaction that triggers something. Whether it is
something implicit, e.g. loading, scrolling, waiting, or something explicit,
e.g. clicking a specific button right at this moment. We treat the user, who
e.g. is loading something, as the subject. The page (context) is the object and
the action "view" is basically the predicate.

**A user views a page by loading it &rarr; page view.**

Since we want to evolve the classic, static concept of an event **we split the
action (view) from the object (page)** .Just because there are so many more
possibilities that can be done with the same object.

To sum up: **an elbwalker event consists of three components: a trigger (load),
an entity (page) and an action (view)** . Now we're free to do a lot of great
things! So let's get started.

## How this concept makes your life in measurement much easier

It's nice to know that a page view has happened, but we also want to know which
page exactly had that view. Also, the information “click” isn't worth a lot, if
we don't know what exactly has been clicked by someone. We need to **know the
context** to know that it was the add to cart button of a specific product in a
specific size. Most of the time, the more context, the better.

**Context creates meaning. Context is everything**

An elbwalker entity is defining the scope to create a specific context. Inside
this entity scope, all actions are to be defined. As a data person, I want to
know which product someone added to the cart. As a data person, I want to know
which page someone viewed. And so on. To capture this information you can add
properties to an elbwalker event. You will likely know this from e.g.
[Google Analytics 4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4)
implementations.

There are endless possibilities of what someone can do on a page. There is no
need to just focus on the view, and create weird concepts like bounce rates.
Let's move on and measure the read action in addition to the view action of a
page. And how about measuring the user's feedback like the like action or share
action? Imagine all the new possibilities we can now analyze and report and how
we can personalize and optimize based on the context of a page.

| Entity  | Actions                             |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| page    | view<br />read<br />like<br />share |
| product | view<br />add<br />save<br />like   |

We've built the [walker](https://docs.elbwalker.com/sources/web) to support this
new approach of event tracking. The combination of an attributed-based tracker
and the new event concept makes tracking implementation with elbwalker so
**easy, fast and natural** .
