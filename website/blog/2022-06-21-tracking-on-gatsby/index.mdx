This guide will explain how you can implement and use walker.js on single-page
applications. We will demonstrate the implementation on our own website that
uses gatsby.js without using plugins. ü§ì

## Getting started

First, make a plan of what events you want to measure. Those can be
business-related conversion goals or usage events you want to keep track of.
Secondly, add the walker to your website.

To set up the walker.js for a project using gatsby.js you have to do the
following steps:

### 1. In gatsby-ssr.js:

We want to load the walker.js on every page by default. Use the
[gatsby-ssr.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/)
to add it to the head of your page statically.

We also want the small helper function walker that can be used to configure the
walker.js. We'll use it to push new events to the elbLayer, on a new page view
e.g.

```js
export const onRenderBody = ({ setHeadComponents }) => {
  setHeadComponents(
    [<script key="walker" async className="elbwalker" src="walker.js" />],
    [
      <script
        key="walker_function"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
          __html: function elb(...args: unknown[]) {
            (window.elbLayer = window.elbLayer || []).push(...args);
          },
        }}
      />,
    ],
  );
};
```

### 2. In gatsby-browser.js:

Triggering a new page load each time the route changes is necessary. Pushing the
"walker run" event will tell the walker.js to reinitialize and trigger all
load-actions on a page.

```js
export function walker(...args) {
  (window.elbLayer = window.elbLayer || []).push(...args);
}

export const onRouteUpdate = () => {
  walker('walker run');
};
```

### Is the walker.js working?

You can quickly check whether the setup is working or not by typing ‚ÄúelbLayer‚Äù
in the browser console once you have opened your site.

### Tagging your site

In this example we keep it simple and only want to tag some basic click events
on our homepage:

1. Clicks on our Github repo
2. Clicks on our Login button
3. Clicks on our ‚Äúschedule call‚Äù button (hero, cta)

### Tagging GitHub repo buttons

First, we want to tag some outbound-clicks to the walker.js GitHub repository.
There are multiple ways how users are getting redirected to the repository.. for
example, through a banner, hero, navigation, cta, and footer. In the following
example, the `banner`, as well as the hero banner, is getting tagged.

It makes sense to tag all these different positions and pages where the click
event could be fired. Afterwards, it is possible to see precisely which button
was used and how many times. This leads to a clean data output.

### position: banner

As seen in the picture you only have to set three HTML attributes to collect the
banner click triggered by a user. Check out our [docs](/docs/) if you are not
too familiar with how the walker.js works.

```JSX
<Banner
  data-elb="github"
  data-elb-github="position: banner"
  className="font-medium text-white"
>
  Big news! The walker is now open-source.
  <a
    href="https://github.com/elbwalker/walkerOS"
    data-elbaction="click"
  >
    Open GitHub
  </a>
</Banner>
```

### position: cta

The entity and the trigger stay the same.

Using "cta" instead of "banner" as position on the `data-elb`-attribute will
lead to an event with a respective property (banner or hero) in the analytics
tool since we can now differ between a GitHub redirect clicked through either
the banner or hero section

```html
<div data-elb="github" data-elb-github="position:cta">
  <a href="https://github.com/elbwalker/walkerOS" data-elbaction="click">
    Go to GitHub
  </a>
</div>
```

### Tagging Login button

Tagging the login button used on our homepage is as easy as tagging the GitHub
click. Since there is only one login button on the entire page, it is not
necessary to specify the position.

```html
<button data-elb="login" data-elbaction="click">Log in</button>
```

### Tagging schedule call button

```html
<div data-elb="call" data-elb-call="position: hero">
  <a href="https://calendly.com/elbwalker-demo/30min" data-elbaction="click">
    Schedule a free discovery call
  </a>
</div>
```

### elbglobals

Summing up the used tagging delivers information of three click events incl.
position property (e.g. banner, cta, footer).

But we are still missing important information: On which page the event was
fired. That's what `elbglobals` are used for!

elbglobals can be defined anywhere on a page and will be collected once, right
before the first event is fired.

```js
export default function Layout({ children, pagetype }) {
  return (
    <div data-elbglobals={ pagetype } >
  )}
```

### dataLayer

We can now exactly track where our event was fired. In this example, the
`gitHub click` event was fired on the **company** page.

```js
{
  "action": "click",
  "count": 2,
  "data": { "position": "banner" },
  "entity": "github",
  "event": "github click",
  "globals": { "pagetype": "company" },
  "group": "01b5e2",
  "id": "1647968113641-b4b9h9-5",
  "nested": [],
  "timestamp": 1647968113641,
  "timing": 13.37,
  "trigger": "click",
  "user": {},
  "version": { "walker": 1.3, "config": 1 },
  "walker": true
}
```

elbglobals are an excellent way to specify the context of an event flexibly
without limitation. They are so powerful that we will dedicate another single
blog post to them.
