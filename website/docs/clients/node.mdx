# Node Client

The walkerOS Node Client is designed for efficient event tracking and data
collection in Node.js environments, offering seamless integration for event
handling, destination management, and consent protocol compliance.

## Installation

To install the walkerOS Node Client in your project, use the following command:

```sh
npm install @elbwalker/client-node
```

## Configuration

Start by configuring the client with the `createNodeClient` function.
Optionally, you can pass a `customConfig` object for initial settings.

```ts
import { createNodeClient } from '@elbwalker/client-node';
const { elb, instance } = createNodeClient(customConfig);
```

Configuration options include:

- `consent`: An object representing the consent states.
- `custom`: Custom state support for individual setups.
- `destinations`: An object containing all destinations.
- `globals`: Global properties that are added to each event by default.

## Core Functions

### init

Before pushing events to a destination, the client checks for an init function
in the destination. If available, it's called asynchronously. The function
should return false on error, which will prevent any events from being
processed. Alternatively, it can return a complete destination config that will
be used for pushing events.

### push

The push function is the core of the node client. It can either process commands
or handle events. Commands are processed when the function is called with a
string starting with "walker", like `elb("walker config", configData);`. Events
are processed otherwise.

The function performs consent checks before pushing events to destinations.
Events are pushed in parallel and support batching.

```ts
const result = await elb('entity action', eventData);
```

## Event Lifecycle

1. **Run Initialization**: Similar to a web page view, each run reinitializes
   the client's state.
2. **Event Creation**: Events are formulated and queued internally.
3. **Consent Verification**: Consent is checked before pushing events.
4. **Destination Management**: Events are sent to destinations based on consent
   and configuration settings.

## Adding Destinations

You can add destinations dynamically using the destination command.

```ts
elb('walker destination', destination, config);
```

This is useful for handling events that were pushed before the destination was
added or if consent was granted afterward.

:::note

The client stores events for each run. If a destination is added later or if
consent changes, these previous events are also processed.
