A node client can either be created with a
custom&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/clients/node/installation#configuration">config</Link>
during initialization or updated via commands using the `elb` function.

## elb

The `elb` function gets returned when creating a node client. It pushes events
and commands to the instance and runs asynchronously by returning a promise.

```ts
import { nodeClient } from '@elbwalker/client-node';
const { elb } = nodeClient();

const result = await elb('entity action', { foo: 'bar' });
```

## Configuration

To&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/clients/node/installation#configuration">configure</Link>
the node client either do it while creating an instance or use the
`walker config` command:

```js
elb('walker config', {
  globalsStatic: {}, // Static attributes added to each event
  onError: console.log, // Custom error handler
  onLog: console.error, // Custom logging
});
```

## Run

A run can be seen like a cycle where all events are processed in the same
`group`. A run is required to start the processing of events. Before starting a
run all IDs and configurations should be set.

```js
elb('walker run');
```

## Destinations

The `walker destination` command adds a destination to the node client.

```js
const destinationLog = { push: console.log };
elb('walker destination', destinationLog, {
  /* destination config */
});
```

## Consent Management

management in detail</Link>.

Those names can be defined arbitrarily, but common groups are functional,
analytics, and marketing. Values are booleans, and once a value is set to `true`
it's treated as consent being granted. Previously pushed events during the run
are now shared with destinations and new ones.

```js
elb('walker consent', { marketing: true, randomTool: true });
```

Setting a consent state to `false` will immediately stop a destination from
processing any events.

## User

Setting the user IDs. There are three levels for user identification. Typically,
the user is a company's internal ID. In contrast, the device ID can be treated
as a value stored in a cookie for a more extended period, and the session can be
used for temporary identification.

```js
elb('walker user', {
  id: 'us3r',
  device: 'c00k13',
  session: 's3ss10n',
  hash: getHash(str),
});
```

The new user IDs have been added to each event. Make sure only to use hashed or
anonymous ids.

```js
{
  "event": "entity action",
  "user": {
    "id": "us3r",
    "device": "c00k13",
    "session": "s3ss10n"
    "hash": "h4sh3d"
  }
  // other properties omitted
}
```

:::caution

We highly recommend only using fully anonymized & arbitrary IDs by default and
checking your options with persistent user IDs with your data protection
officer.
