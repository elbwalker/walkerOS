# Web Client walker.js

Walker.js is an open library to capture user events and send them to any
analytics tool. It is created to enable data ownership, improve web data
quality, and scale tracking implementation processes in a reliable way.

## Basic idea

Setting up a complete tracking with HTML attributes. Use the elb-attributes
`data-elb`, `data-elbaction`, `data-elb-*`, `data-elbcontext`, and
`data-elbglobals` for tagging.

```html
<body data-elbglobals="language:en">
  <div data-elbcontext="test:engagement">
    <div data-elb="promotion" data-elbaction="visible:view">
      <h1 data-elb-promotion="name:Setting up tracking easily">
        Setting up tracking easily
      </h1>
      <p data-elb-promotion="category:analytics">Analytics</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

Your web event is built on the fly

```js
{
  event: 'promotion view',
  data: {
    name: 'Setting up tracking easily',
    category: 'analytics',
  },
  context: { test: ['engagement', 0] },
  custom: {},
  globals: { language: 'en' },
  user: {},
  nested: [],
  consent: {},
  id: '1647261462000-01b5e2-5',
  trigger: 'visible',
  entity: 'promotion',
  action: 'view',
  timestamp: 1647261462000,
  timing: 3.14,
  group: '01b5e2',
  count: 2,
  version: { client: '1.0.0', tagging: 0 },
  source: {
    type: 'web',
    id: 'https://www.elbwalker.com/docs/clients/walkerjs',
    previous_id: 'https://github.com/elbwalker/walkerOS'
  }
}
```

### Introducing

Walker.js is an implementation layer that creates reliable event data with
context. It adds maximum **ownership** and **scalability** to your web-tracking
implementation.

If you...

- take the users' **privacy** seriously and want to track **first-party**
- **regularly ship new features** and landing pages and constantly need to make
  sure you added the tracking correctly
- have a continuously growing user interface and you find measuring **in-depth
  behavioral data** on the usage difficult to implement

... walker.js might be just what you're looking for.

### Coupled with markup (like CSS)

We're building upon **data attributes** instead of writing manual code. Yes,
this means that in general, you can **only measure what your users really see,
click, and do** on your website or within your web app. What's not in your
markup can't be measured with the walker.js.

This is because in most of the cases where tracking code breaks it happens when
the **UI is being changed** or further developed and nobody thought about the
tracking. It's often too far away from the core product development. It's much

**less likely to remove** attributes that are used throughout the whole markup.
Somebody will at least ask what they are and do.

### Entity-action event model

One of the great things about walkerOS is the full **flexibility** of event
definitions. You can build your tracking based on your **business logic**
instead of trying to press your business logic into analytics specs.

We believe that tracking shouldn't sound like some abstract technical concept.
It should feel **natural** and everyone involved should immediately understand
it. Only when everyone understands what is being measured, there will be **fewer
misunderstandings, higher data quality**, and more actionable data in the
organization at the end of the day.

A walkerOS event consists of three components: a **trigger** (e.g. load), an
**entity** (e.g. page), and an **action** (e.g. view).

### Vendor-agnostic

Walker.js is generally not made to replace any of your tools, but to **deliver
them better data**. One event captured with walker.js can be sent to **many
destinations** at the same time. However, if you want to replace analytic tools
like Google Analytics you can do this by using walker.js and the event pipe
destination.
