## CDN

To quickly try it out, you can also grab the latest default walker.js
configuration via CDN. Add the script tag to the < head > of your HTML file.

```js
<script
  async
  class="elbwalker"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@elbwalker/walker.js@latest/dist/walker.js"
  data-default="true"
></script>
```

:::note

It's recommended to use the externally hosted version only for demo purposes and
not in production. Also, be aware of the latest version, better use a specific
version like 1.6

:::

In most of the examples, you'll find the imported elb function. The hosted
browser version also comes with it but should be loaded async. Add the following
snippet manually in addition to the script:

```js
<script>
  function elb(){(window.elbLayer = window.elbLayer || []).push(arguments);}
</script>
```
