To integrate walker.js with your website, you can use this
[NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elbwalker/walker.js) to package the
walker directly into your project. To get started with the installation, run:

```js
npm i --save @elbwalker/walker.js
```

:::caution[Caution] This NPM module is only meant to be used for a browser
installation. ::: As a next step run the following code snippet once:

```js
import Elbwalker from '@elbwalker/walker.js';
window.elbwalker = Elbwalker({
  // custom config
});
```

To configure and communicate with the walker you can use the elb-helper
function:

```js
import { elb } from '@elbwalker/walker.js';
elb('entity action', data, trigger, context, nested); // push events
elb('walker <command>', data); // configure walker, see Commands
```

When using a Single Page Application like React, tell the walker to run on each
location change in your app, like a real pageview:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Route, Routes, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
import Elbwalker, { elb } from '@elbwalker/walker.js';

window.elbwalker = Elbwalker({ default: true });

export default function App() {
  const location = useLocation();
  React.useEffect(() => {
    elb('walker run'); // party hard!
  }, [location]);

  return <Routes>// ...</Routes>;
}
```
