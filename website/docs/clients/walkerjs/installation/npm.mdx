description: Install walker.js as an NPM package.
---

import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

Use
the&nbsp;<Link to="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elbwalker/walker.js">@elbwalker/walker.js</Link>
package to integrate it directly into your project. To get started with the
installation, run:

```js
npm i --save @elbwalker/walker.js
```

As a next step run the following code snippet once to create an instance.

```js
import { webClient } from '@elbwalker/walker.js';

window.walkerjs = webClient({
  /* custom config */
});
```

Then to configure and communicate with the walker.js instance load the
`elb`-helper function:

```js
import { elb } from '@elbwalker/walker.js';

window.elb = elb;
elb('entity action', data, trigger, context, nested); // push events
elb('walker <command>', data); // configure walker, see Commands
```

## Single Page Applications

When using a Single Page Application like React, tell the walker to run on each
location change in your app, like a real pageview:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Route, Routes, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
import Elbwalker, { elb } from '@elbwalker/walker.js';

window.walkerjs = Elbwalker({ default: true });

export default function App() {
  const location = useLocation();
  React.useEffect(() => {
    elb('walker run'); // party hard!
  }, [location]);

  return <Routes>// ...</Routes>;
}
```
