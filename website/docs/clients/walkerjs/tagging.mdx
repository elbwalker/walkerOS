# General usage

You can implement all sorts of front-end user events easily with walker.js. From
product and UX events like promotion view, filter usage, etc. to e-commerce
actions like product add to carts or order complete events. The walker.js
handles all trigger initializations and race conditions, builds the events with
context, and distributes them based on consent states and mapping definitions to
any destinations.

Tag a page with...

```html
<!-- Generic usage -->
<div
  data-elb="ENTITY"
  data-elb-ENTITY="KEY:VALUE"
  data-elbaction="TRIGGER:ACTION"
  data-elbcontext="KEY:VALUE"
  data-elbglobals="KEY:VALUE"
/>

<!-- Example usage -->
<div data-elbglobals="language:en">
  <div data-elbcontext="test:engagement">
    <div data-elb="promotion" data-elbaction="visible:view">
      <h1 data-elb-promotion="name:Setting up tracking easily">
        Setting up tracking easily
      </h1>
      <p data-elb-promotion="category:analytics">Analytics</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

...get a full event like the following as a result:

```js
{
  event: 'promotion view', // combination of entity and action
  data: {
    // arbitrary set properties with the data-elb-promotion attribute
    name: 'Setting up tracking easily',
    category: 'analytics',
  },
  context: {
    // Related properties defined with the data-elbcontext attribute
    test: ['engagement', 0] // Value and order
  },
  globals: {
    // General Properties defined with the data-elbglobals attribute
    language: 'en'
  },
  user: {
    // stored user ids (manually added once)
    id: 'userid',
    device: 'cookieid',
    session: 'sessionid',
  },
  nested: [], // all nested entities within the promotion
  consent: { functional: true }, // status of the consent state(s)
  id: '1647968113641-01b5e2-5', // timestamp, group & count of the event
  trigger: 'visible', // name of the trigger that fired
  entity: 'promotion', // entity name
  action: 'view', // entity action
  timestamp: 1647968113641, // time when the event fired
  timing: 3.14, // how long it took from the page load to trigger the event
  group: '01b5e2', // random group id for all events on a page
  count: 2, // incremental counter of the events on a page
  version: {
    // Helpful when working with raw data
    walker: 1.5, // used walker.js version
    config: 42, // a custom configuration version number
  },
  source: {
    // Origins of the event
    type: 1, // Source type of the event (1=Web)
    id: 'https://github.com/elbwalker/walker.js', // Source id of the event's origin (url)
    previous_id: 'https://www.elbwalker.com/' // Previous source id of the event's origin (referrer)
  },
  walker: true, // flag to filter events
}
```

You are completely **free to define naming conventions**. All you need to get
started are the **entity, action & trigger** attributes. Learn more about the
[event modell](https://www.elbwalker.com/blog/elbwalker-event-concept) in our
blog.

1. You define the **entity scope** by setting the data-elb attribute with the
   name of an entity to an element, e.g. `data-elb="promotion"`. The default
   entity page, when there is no data-elb.
2. An **action** can be added by setting the data-elbaction attribute on the
   **same level or all child** elements in combination with a **matching
   trigger**, e.g. `data-elbaction="visible:view"` to fire a promotion view
   event when a user clicks on the tagged element.
3. (Optional) To define the entities' **properties**, set the **composited
   attribute** data-elb-ENTITY with the name and value, e.g.
   `data-elb-promotion="name:Setting up tracking easily;position:overlay"`.

## Trigger

Walker.js comes with a bunch of pre-built triggers. You don't have to deal with
event listener or mutation observer initialization anymore.

| **Event** | **Definition**                                                                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| load      | after loading a page when the DOM is ready                                                                                |
| click     | when the element or a child is clicked                                                                                    |
| visible   | after the element has been in the viewport for at least 50% for one second                                                |
| hover     | each time the mouse enters the corresponding element                                                                      |
| submit    | on a valid form submission                                                                                                |
| wait(ms)  | waits ms seconds (15 seconds by default) until triggering                                                                 |
| pulse(ms) | recurring trigger every ms seconds (15 seconds by default) if page is not hidden                                          |
| custom    | calling elbLayer.push(), see [using JavaScript](/docs/clients/walkerjs/using-javascript)                                  |
| scroll(y) | fires when min. y percent of the element's height is above the bottom of the window, e.g. scroll(80) for an 80% threshold |

:::caution

Trigger names are predefined and need to be selected from the list while the
`action` can be an arbitrarily defined name.

:::

### Abbreviation

If the trigger and action values are equal, e.g. for click events, you can just
shorten the implementation:

```html
<b data-elbaction="click"
  >short** is equal to <s data-elbaction="click:click">long</s></b
>
```

### Parameters

Some triggers require more information during their initialization, others
accept optional parameters. A scroll trigger needs to know about the percentage
a user scrolls down while a wait trigger wants to know about the number of
milliseconds until the action gets triggered. Use brackets behind the trigger to
pass that information.

```html
<!-- specifying trigger parameters -->
<p data-elbaction="wait(10):interested"></p>
<p data-elbaction="pulse(10):interested"></p>
```

### Action filter

At some point, you might want to nest an entity inside another. To prevent an
action to trigger both entities you can restrict the action to a specific entity
by adding the name, e.g. data-elbaction="load:view(product)".If the trigger
event gets called, the result will only include the property values from the
specific entities.

```html
<!-- setting a filter for an entity -->
<div data-elb="foo">
  <div data-elb="bar" data-elbaction="load:hello(bar)">
    only the bar hello event fires.
  </div>
</div>
```

### Up-bubbling click trigger

By clicking an element the event is bubbling up to the body element. If the
walker finds a data-elbaction with the click trigger it will fire the action.
It's often the image or a whole div-block that gets clicked, not the parent
a-element. Using the bubbling-up flow, the walker still triggers the actions for
you.

```html
<button data-elb="product" data-elbaction="click">
  <img class="full" src="some.jpg" alt="" />
</button>
```

:::caution

The click trigger uses the bubbling-up process. It will not work with
stopPropagation or preventDefault.

:::

## Linking elements

Use the `data-elblink` tag to extend the scope of an entity by other elements,
placed somewhere else (like modals). Linked elements are related by some id.
They are hierarchically and can either be a parent or a child.

```html
<div data-elb="info" data-elblink="details:parent">...</div>
...
<div data-elblink="details:child" data-elbaction="visible">...</div>
<p data-elblink="another:child">...</p>
```

The second element is the parent, triggering the visible action for the
`info visible` event. There can be multiple children, but only one parent
element per id.

:::note

`data-elb`, `data-elbaction`, `data-elbcontext`, `data-elbglobals`, and
`data-elblink` are reserved attributes whereas `data-elb-*` attributes may be
arbitrary combinations based on the related entity name. Actions and properties
can be set anywhere inside an elb scope.

:::

:::caution

Spaces in entities, e.g. "shopping cart" or actions, e.g. "add to cart" will be
replaced by underscores to "shopping_cart" and "add_to_cart".

:::

:::tip

Spaces in property values are no problem, e.g. `"category: 'summer sale'"` works
fine. But better set them in quotes when doing so or when using symbols,
especially `:` or `;`

:::

## Properties

### Basic attributes

Use the name of the entity to specify its properties. Property attributes have
to be inside of the entity-scope

```html
<div data-elb="entity">
  <p data-elb-entity="key:value" />
  <p data-elb-entity="foo:bar" />
</div>
```

### Type casting

Property values will be casted to their type, supporting string, number &
boolean.

```html
<div data-elb="types">
  <p data-elb-types="string:text">{ string: "text" }</p>
  <p data-elb-types="int:42;float:3.14">{ int: 42, float: 3.14 }</p>
  <p data-elb-types="bool:true">{ bool: true }</p>
</div>
```

### Multiple attributes

Browsers override duplicate attributes. Hence an element can only have one
`data-elb`, `data-elb-ENTITY`, and/or data-elbaction attribute at a time.
Nevertheless, it’s possible to define multiple entities, properties, and/or
actions all at once within one attribute using quotes and semicolons. Key-value
pairs are split by a semicolon. Therefore it’s necessary to escape values
containing a semicolon. Quotes are here to meet your needs. To prevent a
mistaken value-split use single quotes.

```html
<!-- value wrapping with quotes -->
<p data-elb="foo" data-elb-foo="b:a;r">{ "b": "a", "r": true }</p>
<p data-elb="foo" data-elb-foo="b:'a;r'">{ "b": "a;r" }</p>
```

If a single quote is part of the value escape it with a backslash:

```html
<!-- escaping values with backslash -->
<p data-elb="foo" data-elb-foo="bar:it\'s escaped">{ "bar": "it's escaped" }</p>
```

The semicolon can be used as a separator to list multiple values inside of a
`data-elb` or `data-elbaction` attribute.

```html
<!-- using multiple key-value pairs at once -->
<p data-elb="foo" data-elb-foo="a:1;b:2">{ "a": 1, "b": 2 }</p>
```

### Dynamic field values

You might want to measure dynamic field values e.g. the quantity of a product or
the value of the selected element. Use a `#` at the beginning followed by the
attributes name to get access to the value of the element attribute.

```html
<!-- Basic usage: elb-ENTITY="KEY:#VALUE" -->
<input type="text" value="blue" data-elb-product="color:#value"></input>
<div data-elb-product="name:#innerHTML">Everyday Ruck Snack</div>
```

To capture a selected option from a list use `elb-ENTITY="KEY:#selected"` to get
size:20L

```html
<select data-elb-product="size:#selected">
  <option value="18L">18L</option>
  <option value="20L" selected="selected">20L</option>
</select>
```

### Arrays

To use array types add the `[]` suffix to a properties name, like `size[]:m`.
The walker.js will generate de-duplicated data properties.

```html
<div data-elb="product">
  <p data-elb-product="size[]:s;size[]:l"></p>
  <p data-elb-product="size[]:l"></p>
</div>
```

```js
{
  data: {
    size: ["s", "l"],
  },
  // ...
}
```

### Generic properties

Leave the entity name empty (only `data-elb-`) to add the property to any
related entity. Explicitly named properties are preferred over generic ones.
It's suggested to prefer explicit properties over generic ones.

```html
<div data-elb-="p:v">
  <div data-elb="generic">
    <p data-elb-generic="k:v"></p>
    <p data-elb-="g:v"></p>
    <p data-elb-generic="o:v"></p>
    <p data-elb-="o:x"></p>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
{
  data: {
    p: 'v', // parent
    k: 'v', // explicit
    g: 'v', // generic
    o: 'v' // overridden by explicit
  },
  // ...
}
```

## Globals

There might be properties that don't belong to just one event but to **all
events on a page**. Those properties are called the globals and will be
**collected once**, right before the first event got fired. The globals are
arbitrary like the data property. What is special about them is that you can
define them anywhere on a page by using the `data-elbglobals` attribute.

```html
<div data-elbglobals="outof:scope"></div>

<div data-elb="entity" data-elb-entity="foo:bar" data-elbaction="load:action" />
```

This example will lead to the following event:

```js
{
  "event": "entity action",
  "data": { "foo": "bar" },
  "globals": { "outof": "scope" }
  // other properties omitted
}
```

:::note

For reasons of performance, the globals are only collected once per run.

:::

## Context

All entities inside a defined context want to know about their context. Those
are not as relevant as globals for every event, but helpful information for
every framing context of an event it is embedded in. A context could be a
position or test for example.

```html
<div data-elbcontext="test:engagement" data-elbglobals="plan:paid">
  <div data-elbcontext="recommendation:smart_ai">
    <div
      data-elb="promotion"
      data-elbaction="click"
      data-elb-promotion="title:click me"
    >
      click me
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The context properties are tuples with the value and an index, starting at the
closest parent (`[value, index]`). Access them via `event.context.key[0]`.

```js
{
  event: "promotion click",
  data: { title: "click me" },
  globals: { plan: "paid" },
  context: {
    test: ["engagement", 1],
    recommendation: ["smart_ai", 0],
  },
  // other properties omitted
}
```

## Nested entities

A `data-elb` entity within another `data-elb` entity is called a **nested
entity**.

The walker runs through the nested entities and treats them like regular
entities by gathering all related information. Nested entities are accessible in
the nested array of each event. Each element is a regular entity.

```html
<div
  data-elb="mother"
  data-elb-mother="label:caring"
  data-elbaction="load:view"
>
  <div data-elb="son" data-elb-son="age:23"></div>
  <div data-elb="daughter" data-elb-daughter="age:32">
    <div data-elb="baby" data-elb-baby="status:infant"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

This example will lead to the following event on load:

```js
{
  "event": "mother view",
  "data": { "label": "caring" },
  "nested": [
    { "type": "son", "data": { "age": 23 } },
    {
      "type": "daughter",
      "data": { "age": 32 },
      "nested": [{ "type": "baby", "data": { "status": "infant" } }],
    },
    { "type": "baby", "data": { "status": "infant" } },
  ],
  // other properties omitted
}
```

Nested entities that are nested inside another entity will be captured on both
levels.

:::caution

Nested entities are not available for auto-captured page view events.
