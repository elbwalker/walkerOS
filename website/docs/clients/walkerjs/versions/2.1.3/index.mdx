Walker.js is an open library to capture user events and send them to
any&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/destinations/web/">web destination</Link>. It is
created to improve data richness and make tracking implementation robust and
scalable.

## Basic idea

The basic idea of walker.js is to set up a complete tracking with HTML
attributes. Use the elb-attributes `data-elb`, `data-elbaction`, `data-elb-*`,
`data-elbcontext`, and `data-elbglobals`
for&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/clients/walkerjs/tagging">tagging</Link>.

Add some tags in your HTML...

```html
<body data-elbglobals="language:en">
  <div data-elbcontext="test:engagement">
    <div data-elb="promotion" data-elbaction="visible:view">
      <h1 data-elb-promotion="name:Setting up tracking easily">
        Setting up tracking easily
      </h1>
      <p data-elb-promotion="category:analytics">Analytics</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

... and your web event is built on the fly:

```js
{
  event: 'promotion view', // Name as a combination of entity and action
  data: {
    // Arbitrary properties related to the entity
    name: 'Setting up tracking easily',
    category: 'analytics',
  },
  context: {
    // Provides additional information about the state during the event
    test: ['engagement', 0] // Key, [value, order]
  },
  globals: {
    // General properties that apply to every event
    language: 'en'
  },
  custom: {}, // Additional space for individual setups
  user: {
    // Contains user identifiers for different identification levels
    // Require consent and set manually for sessions building and cross-device
    id: 'us3r1d',
    device: 'c00k131d',
    session: 's3ss10n1d',
  },
  nested: [],
  consent: { functional: true }, // Status of the granted consent state(s)
  id: '1647261462000-01b5e2-5', // Timestamp, group & count of the event
  trigger: 'visible', // Name of the trigger that fired
  entity: 'promotion', // The entity name involved in the event
  action: 'view', // The specific action performed on the entity
  timestamp: 1647261462000, // Time when the event fired
  timing: 3.14, // Duration how long it took to trigger this event
  group: '01b5e2', // Random identifier for all events during a run
  count: 2, // Incremental counter of the events in the same run
  version: {
    // Information about the used implementation setup
    client: 'X.X.X', // Semantic version of the used client
    tagging: 42, // A version number of the then-used tagging status
  },
  source: {
    // Details about the origin of the event
    type: 'web', // Source type of the event (also app, server, or custom one)
    id: 'https://github.com/elbwalker/walkerOS', // Source of the event's origin
    previous_id: 'https://www.elbwalker.com/' // Previous source (like referrer)
  }
}
```
