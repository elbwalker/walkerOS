# Collector

The Collector is the central processing engine of walkerOS that receives events
from sources, enriches them with additional data, applies consent rules, and
routes them to destinations. It acts as the intelligent middleware between event
capture and event delivery.

## What It Does

The Collector transforms raw events into enriched, compliant data streams by:

- **Event Processing** - Validates, normalizes, and enriches incoming events
- **Consent Management** - Applies privacy rules and user consent preferences
- **Data Enrichment** - Adds session data, user context, and custom properties
- **Destination Routing** - Sends processed events to configured analytics
  platforms

## Key Features

- **Universal Compatibility** - Works in both web browsers and server
  environments
- **Privacy-First** - Built-in consent management and data protection
- **Event Validation** - Ensures data quality and consistency
- **Flexible Routing** - Send events to multiple destinations simultaneously

## Architecture Role

In the walkerOS data flow, the Collector sits between sources and destinations:

```
Sources → Collector → Destinations
```

Sources capture events and send them to the Collector, which processes and
routes them to your chosen destinations like Google Analytics, custom APIs, or
data warehouses.

## Getting Started

Learn how to configure and use the Collector:

  collector settings, consent, and global properties
- **<Link to="/docs/collector/commands">Commands</Link>** - Control collector
  behavior with runtime commands
- **<Link to="/docs/collector/testing">Testing</Link>** - Validate your
  collector setup and event flow

The Collector provides the reliability and control you need to ensure your
analytics data is accurate, compliant, and delivered to the right destinations.
