# Collectors

Collectors are the core engines of walkerOS that gather events from your
applications. They provide the foundation for event tracking by managing state,
handling consent, and distributing events to destinations.

## Overview

walkerOS offers two types of collectors, each optimized for their respective
environments:

- **[Web Collector](/docs/collectors/web/)** - Browser-based event collection
  for websites and web applications
- **[Server Collector](/docs/collectors/server/)** - Server-side event
  collection for Node.js environments

## How Collectors Work

Collectors act as the central hub for your event data flow:

1. **Event Collection** - Capture events from various sources (HTML attributes,
   JavaScript calls, API requests)
2. **State Management** - Maintain global state, user sessions, and consent
   preferences
3. **Event Processing** - Validate, enrich, and transform events before
   distribution
4. **Destination Routing** - Send processed events to configured destinations
   (analytics tools, data warehouses, etc.)

## Choosing the Right Collector

### Web Collector

Choose the web collector when you need to:

- Track user interactions on websites or web applications
- Implement client-side analytics
- Handle browser-specific features like page views, clicks, and form submissions
- Manage consent and privacy preferences in the browser

**Use cases:**

- Measuring user behavior for any industry
- Tool aggregation implementations
- Single-page applications (SPAs)
- Progressive web apps (PWAs)

### Server Collector

Choose the server collector when you need to:

- Process events on the backend
- Handle high-volume event streams
- Implement server-side tracking for APIs
- Process events from the web, mobile apps, or backend services

**Use cases:**

- Server-side tracking
- Data pipeline processing

## Key Features

### Unified Architecture

Both collectors share the same core architecture and event format, making it
easy to:

- Move events between client and server
- Maintain consistent data schemas
- Use the same destinations across environments

### Privacy-First Design

- Built-in consent management
- Data anonymization capabilities
- GDPR and privacy regulation compliance
- Configurable data retention policies

### Flexible Integration

- Multiple installation methods
- Framework-agnostic design
- TypeScript support
- Extensive configuration options

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your collector** based on your use case
2. **Install** using your preferred method (npm, CDN, or direct download)
3. **Configure** destinations and settings
4. **Start collecting** events with simple HTML attributes or JavaScript calls

Ready to begin? Start with the [Web Collector](/docs/collectors/web/) for
browser-based tracking or the [Server Collector](/docs/collectors/server/) for
backend event processing.
