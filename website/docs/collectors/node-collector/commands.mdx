import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

A node collector can either be created with a
**custom&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/collectors/node-collector/configuration">config</Link>** during
initialization or updated via **commands** using the `elb` function.

## elb

The `elb` function gets returned when creating a node collector. It pushes events
and commands to the instance and runs asynchronously by returning a promise.

```ts
import { createNodeCollector } from '@walkerOS/node-collector';
const { elb } = createNodeCollector();

const result = await elb('entity action', { foo: 'bar' });
```

## config

To&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/collectors/node-collector/configuration">configure</Link> the node
collector either do it while creating an instance or use the `walker config`
command:

```js
elb('walker config', {
  globalsStatic: {}, // Static attributes added to each event
  onError: console.log, // Custom error handler
  onLog: console.error, // Custom logging
});
```

## run

A run can be seen like a cycle where all events are processed in the same
`group`. A run is required to start the processing of events. Before starting a
run all IDs and configurations should be set.

```js
elb('walker run');
```

## destination

The `walker destination` command adds a destination to the node source.

```js
const destinationLog = { push: console.log };
elb('walker destination', destinationLog, {
  /* destination config */
});
```

## consent

Names can be defined arbitrarily, but common groups are functional, analytics,
and marketing. Values are booleans, and once a value is set to `true` it's
treated as consent being granted. Previously pushed events during a run are now
shared with existing destinations and new ones.

```js
elb('walker consent', { marketing: true, randomTool: true });
```

Setting a consent state to `false` will immediately stop a destination from
processing any events.

## user

There are three levels for user identification. Typically, the user is a
company's internal ID. The device ID can be treated as a value stored in a
cookie for a more extended period, and the session can be used for temporary
identification.

```js
elb('walker user', {
  id: 'us3r',
  device: 'c00k13',
  session: 's3ss10n',
  hash: getHash(str),
});
```

User IDs will be added to each event.

```js
{
  "event": "entity action",
  "user": {
    "id": "us3r",
    "device": "c00k13",
    "session": "s3ss10n"
    "hash": "h4sh3d"
  }
  // other properties omitted
}
```

:::warning

Only use fully anonymized & arbitrary IDs by default and check your options with
persistent user IDs with your data protection officer.
