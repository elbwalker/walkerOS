walkerOS node source is build for being used in a node app or as a part of a
serverless function. The goal is to capture user events, state management, and
sending events to a node destination,
like&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/destinations/node/gcp">BigQuery</Link>.

## Event Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: Similar to a web page view, each run reinitialize the
   source's state.
2. **Event Creation**: Events are formulated and queued internally.
3. **Consent Verification**: Consent is checked before pushing events.
4. **Destination Management**: Events are sent to destinations based on consent
   and configuration settings.
