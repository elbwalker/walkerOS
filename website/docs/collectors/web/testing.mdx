Here are some ideas on how to test your setup easily.

Start by typing `walkerjs` in the console (or the name used during init). This
will show the current state, including `allowed` if the walker.js has been
started using `run` command, `config` object, `destinations`, and `queue` for
all events during the current run.

## Console destination

Add a custom destination where `push` points to console.log to list all events
in the console:

```js
elb('walker destination', { push: console.log });
```

## Tagging

Use the `getAllEvents` method to get all events that have been tagged:

```js
walkerjs.getAllEvents();
```

This will log/return an array of all events, including `entity`, `action`,
`trigger`, `data`, `context`, and `nested`.

To get the `globals` use

```js
walkerjs.getGlobals();
```

## elbLayer

Usually, events get pushed to `window.elbLayer`. You can take a look at the
elbLayer in the console to see events.

:::note

Some events might skip the elbLayer.
