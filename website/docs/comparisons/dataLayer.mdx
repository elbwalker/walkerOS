In the world of web analytics and tag management, Google's `dataLayer` has been
the go-to solution for pushing data to tools like
[Google Tag Manager](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/).
The `dataLayer` is not a tracking tool by itself. Its a global array that acts
as a messaging bus for mainly Google Tag Manager (GTM).

In this post we will compare the `dataLayer` to
[walker.js](https://github.com/elbwalker/walkerOS/tree/main/packages/sources/walkerjs/src),
a modern JavaScript-based event source, that combines necessary and helpful
features for tracking today's web. Built as part of
[walkerOS](https://github.com/elbwalker/walkerOS), it rethinks how tracking
should work in a modern, scalable, and developer-friendly way. walker.js is an
event source, that captures, structures, queues, and routes events.

## The things that need to be done before `dataLayer.push`

With `dataLayer`, you are responsible for collecting, formatting, and pushing
every piece of data manually — often right before a user action occurs. This
means you must:

- Detect the DOM state or user interaction
- Extract all relevant values (e.g. product ID, name, price)
- Wait for consent or tool readiness
- Build the correct structure
- Call `dataLayer.push` manually

walker.js automates all of this. It:

1. Detects the interaction (e.g. button click)
2. Reads the context from your HTML (e.g. data-elb-product="name:#innerText",
   etc.)
3. Waits for consent or other preconditions if needed
4. Enriches the event with metadata (timing, version, session ID, etc.)
5. Pushes a complete structured object — e.g., into the `dataLayer` or any
   destination

With `dataLayer`, you write the push.

With walker.js, you describe the data, and the push just happens — at the right
time, in the right format, and only if allowed.

✅ Advantage: walker.js handles everything upstream of `dataLayer.push` —
removing the need for boilerplate, timing logic, and error-prone setups.

## Tagging

### dataLayer

Tagging via `dataLayer` is often deeply hard-coded into the product or entirely
managed through Google Tag Manager. This approach creates a disconnect between
the website's actual content and the tracking logic. As a result, new features
are frequently launched without proper tracking in place. Because tracking is
decoupled from the core functionality, it's often treated as an afterthought
rather than an integral part of the development and release process.

### walker.js

With walker.js, tagging can be **integrated directly into your HTML** using
`data-elb` attributes. This means your tracking setup is closer to your actual
DOM, making it easier to manage, understand, and version-control as part of your
website codebase. It's a long-proven approach just like using CSS with classes.
It's not entirely new, it's an established method.

walker.js therefore is perfectly made to use with **composable components**. It
creates a **current snapshot** of the site and state, and builds events on the
fly. A component only has to be tagged once and can be tracked multiple times,
in various settings, on multiple pages.

E.g. you can add a [global attribute](/docs/sources/web/browser/tagging#globals)
once and automatically have it available in every event. walker.js also captures
[additional fields](/docs/sources/web/browser/) like event timings,
consent-state, event count or the tagging version automatically. The states of
the events are always up-to-date as a user interacts with certain components on
the screen. Using the dataLayer you'll have to update every single event on its
own.

While it certainly is an effort to add new attributes to each (relevant)
component to start off with, walker.js decreases maintaining, debugging & QA
efforts heavily on the long run. And practically adds tracking to new features
on the fly.

**✅ Advantage: Tagging is integrated into your components, easy to add, ready
to scale.**

## Example: Add to Cart

### `dataLayer` (manual setup)

```js
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'add_to_cart',
  ecommerce: {
    items: [
      { item_id: 'sku123', item_name: 'Cool Hat', price: 29.99, quantity: 1 },
    ],
  },
});
```

- You must gather all item values yourself.
- You must ensure this push happens after the DOM is ready, and after consent is
  granted (typically configured in an external tag manager like GTM)

### walker.js (declarative + automated)

<PromotionReady width="w-1/2" />

walker.js takes care of:

- Listening for clicks
- Collecting product info from data-elb-\*
- Checking consent state
- Formatting the event (e.g., for GA4 or GTM)
- Pushing to dataLayer via the GTM destination

All you had to do was tag the button.

## Summary table

| Feature                | `dataLayer`                        | `walker.js`                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Tagging integration    | Manual pushes                      | Component-level, DOM attribute based |
| Event state management | Manual updates                     | Automatic, real-time state updating  |
| Consent-safe execution | Yes, with manual setup in e.g. GTM | Built-in                             |

## Conclusion

walker.js simplifies and scales modern tracking. While `dataLayer` has served
its purpose for years, it comes with a heavy manual overhead — from state
management to ensuring proper execution timing. It works, but it puts the burden
of tracking logic on developers or external tag managers. walker.js takes a
fundamentally different approach: it brings tracking closer to your actual
product code by using HTML attributes and automation. It reads the DOM, the
consent state, enriches your events, and pushes them where they need to go — all
without micromanaging every interaction.

If you're building modern, component-based websites, or maintaining large-scale
tracking setups, walker.js offers better maintainability, fewer bugs, and faster
iterations. It's built for how the web works today — and where it is going
tomorrow.

## Integration options

We offer serveral ways to integrate with GTM and/or keep using the `dataLayer`:

- **Install walker.js with the tag template:** If you'd like to install
  walker.js using GTM you can use the
  [Google Tag Manager tag template](/docs/sources/web/browser/installation)

- **Use GTM destination:** If you'd like to use
  [walker.js](/docs/sources/web/browser/) as an event source while keeping GTM
  for other tasks, you can use the
  [Google Tag Manager destination](/docs/destinations/web/gtag/gtm) that
  automatically pushes walker events into the `dataLayer`
