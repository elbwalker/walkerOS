description: Compare walkerOS and Google Tag Manager to understand which solution fits your needs.

Google Tag Manager (GTM) has been the industry standard for tag management. But
as privacy regulations tighten and development practices evolve, many teams are
looking for alternatives. Here's how walkerOS compares.

## Quick comparison

| Feature                | GTM                    | walkerOS                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Open-source            | No                     | Yes                       |
| Self-hosted option     | No (server-side costs) | Yes                       |
| Vendor lock-in         | Google ecosystem       | None                      |
| Data ownership         | Google servers         | Your infrastructure       |
| Privacy/GDPR           | Requires configuration | Built-in consent handling |
| Version control        | Limited UI history     | Git-native                |
| Developer experience   | GUI-based              | Code-first                |
| Composable tagging     | No                     | Yes (tag once, use everywhere) |
| Learning curve         | Low (GUI)              | Medium (code)             |
| Works with Google tags | Yes                    | Yes                       |

## Who should use what?

### Choose GTM if

- You prefer GUI-based configuration over code
- You're heavily invested in the Google ecosystem
- You need quick setup without developer resources
- Your team is already trained on GTM

### Choose walkerOS if

- Data privacy and ownership is a priority
- You want version-controlled, reviewable tracking
- You need self-hosted infrastructure
- You're building with modern component frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
- You want tracking to be part of your development workflow

## Key differences

### Data ownership & privacy

**GTM:** Event data flows through Google's servers. While you can configure
privacy settings, you're ultimately trusting Google with your user data.

**walkerOS:** Self-hosted by default. Your data never touches third-party
servers unless you explicitly send it there. Built-in consent management ensures
you only track what you're allowed to.

### Developer experience

**GTM:** GUI-based configuration. Changes are made through a web interface,
making code review difficult. Version history exists but isn't Git-integrated.

**walkerOS:** Config-as-code approach. Tracking is defined in your codebase,
reviewed in pull requests, and deployed with your application. If it works in
staging, it works in production.

### Flexibility

**GTM:** Optimized for Google products (GA4, Google Ads). Third-party
integrations require custom templates or JavaScript.

**walkerOS:** Vendor-agnostic. Send events to any destination — analytics tools,
data warehouses, marketing platforms, or your own APIs. Switch providers without
changing your tracking code.

### Cost

**GTM:** Free to use, but you pay with your data. Server-side GTM has hosting
costs.

**walkerOS:** The software is free and open-source. Self-host on your own
infrastructure with full control over costs. Optional paid services include
implementation support and SLAs for teams that need help getting started or
require guaranteed support.

## Can they work together?

Yes! You don't have to choose one or the other. walkerOS can push events to GTM
via the [GTM destination](/docs/destinations/web/gtag/gtm), letting you:

- Use walkerOS for structured, consent-aware event collection
- Keep GTM if your team is already familiar with it
- Gradually migrate away from GTM at your own pace
