## Key differences

### Cost

**Jentis:** Starts at €490/month for the Advanced plan. Premium and AI-powered
tiers require custom pricing. Enterprise costs can scale significantly.

**walkerOS:** The software is free and open-source. You pay for your own
infrastructure costs. Optional paid services include implementation support
(setup fees) and SLAs for teams that want help getting started or need
guaranteed support.

### Hosting model

**Jentis:** Managed service only. Jentis hosts and maintains everything. You
don't run your own servers, but you also can't.

**walkerOS:** Self-hosted by default. You control where your data lives and how
your infrastructure scales. Full ownership, full responsibility.

### Transparency

**Jentis:** Proprietary and closed-source. You trust their implementation
without being able to audit the code.

**walkerOS:** Fully open-source. Audit the code, understand exactly what's
happening, and contribute improvements.

### Flexibility

**Jentis:** Pre-built connectors and managed platform. Great if their
integrations cover your needs.

**walkerOS:** Build anything, connect anywhere. Create custom destinations for
any API, data warehouse, or internal system.
