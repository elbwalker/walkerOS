[Jitsu](https://jitsu.com/) is an open-source data collection platform often
positioned as a Segment alternative. It focuses on streaming event data to data
warehouses. Here's how it compares to walkerOS.

## Who should use what?

### Choose Jitsu if

- Your primary goal is streaming data to warehouses
- You want automatic identity resolution built in
- You need a simple tracking tag similar to Google Analytics
- You want included ClickHouse storage on the free tier

### Choose walkerOS if

- You want composable, component-level tagging for web
- You need flexibility beyond just warehouse destinations
- You prefer HTML attribute-based tracking over JavaScript SDK
- You want full control over event collection and consent handling
- You're building with modern component frameworks

## Key differences

### Tagging approach

**Jitsu:** JavaScript SDK similar to traditional analytics tools. Add a tracking
script, then call tracking functions in your code.

**walkerOS:** HTML attribute-based tagging. Add `data-elb` attributes to your
components. Events are captured automatically based on user interactions without
writing tracking code for each event.

### Primary focus

**Jitsu:** Warehouse-first. Built to stream data to Snowflake, BigQuery,
Redshift, ClickHouse, etc. The warehouse is the core destination.

**walkerOS:** Destination-agnostic. Send events to warehouses, analytics tools,
marketing platforms, or your own APIs. No single destination type is prioritized.

### Cost

**Jitsu:** Free cloud tier up to 200k events/month with included ClickHouse.
Paid plans start around $40/month. Self-hosted is free (MIT license).

**walkerOS:** The software is free and open-source with no event limits. You pay
for your own infrastructure costs. Optional paid services include implementation
support (setup fees) and SLAs for teams that want help getting started or need
guaranteed support.

### Transformations

**Jitsu:** Jitsu Functions: JavaScript-based processing that runs before data
reaches your warehouse. Filter, modify, or enrich events.

**walkerOS:** Mapping configuration: JavaScript-based transformations that run
in the collector. Transform event data before sending to destinations.

## Can they work together?

Yes! You can use walkerOS for event collection and send data to Jitsu as a
destination. This gives you walkerOS's composable tagging and consent handling
on the frontend, with Jitsu's warehouse streaming on the backend.
