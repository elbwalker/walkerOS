[RudderStack](https://www.rudderstack.com/) is a warehouse-first customer data
platform with both open-source and cloud offerings. It's often positioned as an
open-source alternative to Segment. Here's how it compares to walkerOS.

## Who should use what?

### Choose RudderStack if

- You need a warehouse-first CDP architecture
- You want 200+ pre-built integrations
- Your data team needs JavaScript/Python transformations
- You prefer event-based pricing over MTU-based
- You need advanced features like identity resolution

### Choose walkerOS if

- You want something lightweight and quick to set up
- You prefer truly open-source (MIT) without feature restrictions
- You want composable, component-level tagging for web
- Cost matters — walkerOS is free with no event limits
- You need focused event collection without full CDP complexity

## Key differences

### Open-source approach

**RudderStack:** Open-source core, but advanced features (Transformations, Live
Events) require the cloud version or aren't available in Control Plane Lite.
The open-source version has limitations.

**walkerOS:** Fully open-source under MIT license. All features available, no
restrictions. Use it however you want.

### Complexity and setup

**RudderStack:** Requires Docker or Kubernetes for self-hosting. Separate data
plane and control plane concepts. More infrastructure to manage for the full
feature set.

**walkerOS:** Simpler architecture. Get started quickly without complex
infrastructure requirements. Designed for developers who want control without
overhead.

### Cost

**RudderStack:** Free cloud tier with 1M events/month. Paid plans start at
$750/month with usage-based pricing (events, not MTUs). Self-hosted is "free"
but requires infrastructure investment.

**walkerOS:** The software is free and open-source with no event limits. You pay
for your own infrastructure costs. Optional paid services include implementation
support (setup fees) and SLAs for teams that want help getting started or need
guaranteed support.

### Focus

**RudderStack:** Warehouse-first CDP. Built around the idea that your data
warehouse is the source of truth. Strong focus on data teams and analytics
infrastructure.

**walkerOS:** Event collection and routing. Focused on capturing events well and
sending them where they need to go — warehouses, analytics tools, marketing
platforms, or your own APIs.

### Integrations

**RudderStack:** 200+ pre-built integrations. Great if you need broad coverage
out of the box.

**walkerOS:** Fewer pre-built destinations, but full flexibility to build custom
ones. Better for teams with specific requirements or who prefer owning their
integration code.

## Can they work together?

Yes! You can use walkerOS for event collection and send data to RudderStack as a
destination. This gives you walkerOS's composable tagging and consent handling
on the frontend, while leveraging RudderStack's warehouse integrations and
transformations on the backend.
