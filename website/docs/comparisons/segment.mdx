[Segment](https://segment.com/) (owned by Twilio) is a Customer Data Platform
(CDP) that collects, unifies, and routes customer data. It's one of the most
well-known names in the space. Here's how it compares to walkerOS.

## Key differences

### Scope

**Segment:** A full Customer Data Platform. Beyond event collection, it offers
identity resolution, audience building, journey orchestration, and reverse ETL.
It's designed for marketing and data teams who need unified customer profiles.

**walkerOS:** Focused event collection and routing infrastructure. Collect
events from sources, process them, send them to destinations. It does one thing
well without the CDP overhead.

### Cost

**Segment:** Free tier limited to 1,000 MTUs. Team plan starts around
$120/month. Pricing scales with monthly tracked users (MTUs) — enterprise
customers often negotiate 70-80% discounts on list prices, but costs can grow
quickly at scale.

**walkerOS:** The software is free and open-source. You pay for your own
infrastructure costs. Optional paid services include implementation support
(setup fees) and SLAs for teams that want help getting started or need
guaranteed support.

### Integrations

**Segment:** 700+ pre-built integrations. Connect to almost any marketing,
analytics, or data tool without writing code. Great if your stack is covered.

**walkerOS:** Fewer pre-built destinations, but full flexibility to build
custom integrations. Send data anywhere via destinations you control. Better for
teams with specific requirements or internal systems.

### Data ownership

**Segment:** Data flows through Segment's infrastructure. While they offer
privacy features and compliance certifications, you're trusting a third party
with your customer data.

**walkerOS:** Self-hosted by default. Your data never leaves your
infrastructure unless you explicitly send it somewhere. Full control over where
data lives and how it's processed.

### Developer experience

**Segment:** SDK-based tracking with a GUI for configuration and debugging.
Good documentation, but less control over the underlying behavior.

**walkerOS:** Code-first, config-as-code approach. HTML attribute-based tagging
for web. Version control your tracking setup, review in PRs, test before
production.

## Can they work together?

Yes! You can use walkerOS for event collection and send data to Segment as a
destination. This gives you walkerOS's composable tagging and consent handling
on the frontend, while still feeding data into Segment's CDP for identity
resolution and downstream integrations.
