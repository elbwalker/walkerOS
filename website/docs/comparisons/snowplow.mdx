## Who should use what?

### Choose Snowplow if

- You have a dedicated data engineering team
- You need enterprise-grade data infrastructure at scale
- Your primary goal is feeding data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks)
- You want 35+ pre-built trackers across platforms
- Budget allows for $800+/month or self-hosting resources

### Choose walkerOS if

- You want something lightweight and quick to set up
- You're a developer or small team without dedicated data engineers
- You need flexibility beyond just data warehouse destinations
- You prefer truly open-source (MIT license) over restricted licenses
- You want to start free and scale as needed

## Key differences

### Complexity and setup

**Snowplow:** Enterprise-grade infrastructure designed for large-scale data
operations. Requires significant setup time and often dedicated data engineering
resources. The open-source version needs self-hosting expertise; the managed BDP
starts at $800/month.

**walkerOS:** Lightweight and developer-friendly. Get started in hours, not
weeks. Designed for teams that want tracking infrastructure without the
complexity of enterprise data platforms.

### Licensing

**Snowplow:** The open-source version uses the Snowplow Limited Use License
Agreement (SLULA), which restricts commercial use. Full commercial use requires
their enterprise offering.

**walkerOS:** MIT licensed. Use it however you want: commercially, modify it,
fork it. No restrictions.

### Cost

**Snowplow:** BDP Cloud starts at $800/month. Self-hosted open-source is
"free" but requires significant infrastructure and engineering investment.
Enterprise tiers (Basecamp, Ascent, Summit) scale up with custom pricing.

**walkerOS:** The software is free and open-source. You pay for your own
infrastructure costs. Optional paid services include implementation support
(setup fees) and SLAs for teams that want help getting started or need
guaranteed support.

### Focus and philosophy

**Snowplow:** Built as comprehensive customer data infrastructure (CDI) for
feeding data warehouses and powering analytics at scale. Designed for data teams
building sophisticated data products.

**walkerOS:** Built as flexible event collection and routing. Send data anywhere:
analytics tools, data warehouses, marketing platforms, or your own APIs.
Designed for developers who want control without complexity.

### When they overlap

Both solutions can:
- Collect behavioral event data
- Self-host on your infrastructure
- Send data to warehouses and other destinations
- Handle consent management

The difference is scale and complexity. Snowplow is a full data platform;
walkerOS is focused event infrastructure.

## Can they work together?

Yes! You can use walkerOS for event collection and send data to Snowplow as a
destination. This gives you walkerOS's composable tagging and consent handling
on the frontend, with Snowplow's data infrastructure on the backend.

### Using the Snowplow Destination

The `@walkeros/web-destination-snowplow` package provides full integration:

```typescript
import { startFlow } from '@walkeros/collector';
import { destinationSnowplow } from '@walkeros/web-destination-snowplow';

const { elb } = await startFlow({
  destinations: {
    snowplow: {
      destination: destinationSnowplow,
      config: {
        settings: {
          collectorUrl: 'https://collector.yourdomain.com',
          appId: 'my-app',
          userId: 'user.id', // Cross-session user stitching
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

**Features include:**

- Full ecommerce tracking (product views, cart actions, transactions)
- Cross-session user identity via `setUserId`
- Anonymous tracking mode for privacy compliance
- Page context with `setPageType`
- Global contexts and custom schemas
- Activity tracking (page pings)
- Plugin support (NPM and URL-based)

See the [Snowplow destination documentation](/docs/destinations/web/snowplow) for
full configuration options.
