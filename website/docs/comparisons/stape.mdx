[Stape](https://stape.io/) is a server-side tracking platform focused on hosting
server-side Google Tag Manager (sGTM). They simplify sGTM infrastructure with

## Who should use what?

### Choose Stape if

- You're already using Google Tag Manager and want server-side
- You prefer managed hosting over self-hosting
- You want plug-and-play integrations for Shopify, WordPress, etc.
- You need their specific power-ups (Cookie Keeper, Custom Loader)

### Choose walkerOS if

- You want full control without depending on GTM
- You prefer open-source and no vendor lock-in
- You want to self-host on your own infrastructure
- You're building a code-first, version-controlled tracking setup
- You want to avoid GTM complexity entirely

## Key differences

### Architecture

**Stape:** A hosting layer on top of server-side GTM. You still configure
tracking in GTM's interface — Stape handles the infrastructure. This means you
need GTM knowledge (containers, tags, triggers, custom domains).

**walkerOS:** A standalone event collection system. No GTM required. Define
tracking in code, collect events through the source, process with the collector,
and send to any destination.

### Cost

**Stape:** Starts at $20/month for basic sGTM hosting. Scales with traffic —
high-volume sites can reach $200+/month. Compare to self-hosted sGTM on Google
Cloud which starts around $120/month.

**walkerOS:** The software is free and open-source. You pay for your own
infrastructure costs. Optional paid services include implementation support
(setup fees) and SLAs for teams that want help getting started or need
guaranteed support.

### GTM dependency

**Stape:** Requires Google Tag Manager. You're configuring tracking in GTM's
interface, with Stape providing the server-side infrastructure. If GTM changes,
your setup changes.

**walkerOS:** GTM-independent. While walkerOS can send events to GTM via the
[GTM destination](/docs/destinations/web/gtag/gtm), it doesn't require GTM to
function. Your tracking logic lives in your codebase.

### Flexibility

**Stape:** Focused on the Google ecosystem — GA4, Google Ads, plus Meta and
TikTok gateways. Power-ups are pre-built by Stape.

**walkerOS:** Send events anywhere. Build custom destinations for any API, data
warehouse, or internal system. Full control over data transformation and
routing.
