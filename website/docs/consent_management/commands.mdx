## consent

Typically, a
[Consent Management Platform (CMP)](#consent-management-platforms-cmps) handles
the consent. This is an asynchronous process. The CMP has to be loaded, a user
has to make a choice, and/or the state has to be updated.

To set/update the consent state, the CMP should actively push the
`consent command` with a group or an individual tool's permission state
(`true/false`). If only one condition applies, consent is granted. Updating only
one value won't override existing states.

```js
elb('walker consent', { functional: true, marketing: false });
```

Consent keys can be defined arbitrarily (typically known as _functional_,
_analytics_, and _marketing_). However, you can also use individual names for
each vendor.

The walker handles the **race conditions**: Previously pushed events get
processed in the correct order after granting the consent state with the
destinations as well as new ones.

### Destinations

With each event, the consent states get checked. Every event will be added to an
ordered queue if consent isn't granted yet and the
[destination's queue](/docs/destinations/#configuration) isn't disabled. The
queue resets with each `walker run` command. And will be (re-)processed with
each `walker consent` update. The key must match the key used in each
`destination.config.consent`.

:::note

The queued events properties `consent`, `globals`, and `user` will be
**updated** to the current state before being processed.

:::

:::note

A destination only requires one granted consent state to process events.

:::

To revoke consent and stop sharing events with a destination, all matching rules
have to be set to `false`:

```js
elb('walker consent', { marketing: false });
```

## on Consent

To start walker.js only after a consent choice, use the `on consent` command:

```js
// Wait for functional consent to run
elb('walker on', 'consent', {
  functional: () => {
    elb('walker run');
  },
});

// Later, a CMP has to update the consent state
elb('walker consent', { functional: true });
```

Another example of how to use the `on consent` command might be to update
[Googles consent mode v2](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/guides/consent?consentmode=basic):

```js
elb('walker on', 'consent', (instance, consent) => {
  // Check if marketing consent is granted
  if (consent.marketing) {
    gtag('consent', 'update', {
      ad_user_data: 'granted',
      ad_personalization: 'granted',
      ad_storage: 'granted',
      analytics_storage: 'granted',
    });
  }
});
```

The consent mode will be updated via `gtag` as soon as marketing consent is
granted.
