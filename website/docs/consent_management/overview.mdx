Managing user consent is critical for legal compliance and user privacy.
WalkerOS follows a **privacy-by-design** approach and offers multiple ways to
handle consent and manage data processing to ensure the user's privacy is
respected.

## Features

- Manage consent with the [walker consent](#command) command
- Start the walker only [on available consent](#on-consent)
- Require [consent for destination](#destinations) individually
- Detect [sessions based on consent](/docs/utils/session#consent) state
