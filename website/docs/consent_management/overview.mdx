Managing user consent is critical for legal compliance and user privacy.
WalkerOS follows a **privacy-by-design** approach and offers multiple ways to
handle consent and manage data processing to ensure the user's privacy is
respected.

## Features

- Manage consent with the [walker consent](/docs/consent_management/commands)
  command
- Start the walker only
  [on available consent](/docs/consent_management/commands#on-consent)
- Require
  [consent for destination](/docs/consent_management/commands#destinations)
  individually
- Detect [sessions based on consent](/docs/utils/session#consent) state
