walkerOS is open source and will remain open source. We believe companies should
own their data infrastructure. True data ownership only comes when you control
your data collection. No vendor lock-in, no surprises. You own your code, your
data, your future.

There are multiple ways to contribute, and we appreciate them all.

## Getting started

### Devcontainer (recommended)

The easiest way to start developing is using the
[devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
setup. It automatically installs all dependencies, extensions, and AI-assisted
development tooling.

1. Install the
   [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
   extension in VS Code
2. Open the command palette and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
3. Wait for the container to build. You're ready to code

The `skills/` folder contains step-by-step guides that work with any AI
assistant.

### Manual setup

If you prefer a local setup:

<CodeSnippet
  code={`npm install    # Install dependencies
npm run build  # Build all packages
npm run dev    # Start watch mode
npm run test   # Run tests
npm run lint   # Check code quality`}
  language="bash"
/>

## Ways to contribute

### Code

- Fix bugs or implement new features
- Create new destinations or sources (see `skills/create-destination` and
  `skills/create-source` for guidance)
- Improve existing packages

### Documentation

The documentation lives in `website/docs/`. To run the docs locally:

<CodeSnippet
  code={`cd website && npm run start`}
  language="bash"
/>

- Improve existing documentation
- Add examples and use cases
- Fix typos and clarify explanations

### Community

- <Link to="https://github.com/elbwalker/walkerOS/issues">Report bugs</Link>{" "}
  (issue templates available)
- Suggest features
- Answer questions from other users

## Development workflow

walkerOS uses a test-driven development approach with
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Please run tests before submitting pull requests.

### Adding a changeset

When your PR includes changes that should be released, add a changeset:

<CodeSnippet
  code={`npx changeset`}
  language="bash"
/>

1. Select the packages your PR affects
2. Choose the version bump type:
   - **patch:** bug fixes, minor improvements
   - **minor:** new features (backwards compatible)
   - **major:** breaking changes
3. Write a brief summary of the changes
4. Commit the generated `.changeset/*.md` file with your PR

Changesets help generate accurate changelogs and version packages correctly.
Not every PR needs a changeset. Skip it for documentation, CI changes, or internal
refactoring that doesn't affect published packages.

### Package structure

The project is organized as a monorepo:

```text
packages/
├── core/           # Types, utilities, schemas
├── collector/      # Event processing engine
├── config/         # Shared tooling config
├── web/            # Browser: sources/, destinations/
└── server/         # Node.js: sources/, destinations/

apps/
├── quickstart/     # Validated examples
├── walkerjs/       # Browser bundle
└── demos/          # Demo applications
```
