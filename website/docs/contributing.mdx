## Development workflow

The main language is TypeScript, but others are welcome as well. We use a
test-driven development approach and write tests using
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Since the docs are also part of the repository, they
can be directly updated as well. Pushing code to the repository will trigger a
test-pipeline that runs all tests and checks the code style.

## Packages

walkerOS is separated into multiple packages and developed in a monorepo. The
latest version is under the `develop` branch, while `main` contains the latest
stable and released versions. The whole project can be tested and build using
[TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/repo/). Run all commands from the root
directory.

```bash
# Make sure to install all dependencies first
npm i

# To start a local development server
turbo run dev

# To run all tests
turbo run test

# To build the whole project
turbo run build

# To develop or build a specific package use --filter option
turbo run dev --filter=client-web
turbo run build --filter=client-web --filter=utils
```

The `filter` option can be used to only run one or multiple packages. To filter
use the `packages name` field in the `package.json` file.

## Documentation

The documentation is also included in the repository under the `/website/docs`
folder. It is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). To start a local
server with live reload go to the directory and call:

```bash
npm run start
```
