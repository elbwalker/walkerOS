## Development workflow

The main language is TypeScript, but others are welcome as well. We use a
test-driven development approach and write tests using
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Since the docs are also part of the repository, they
can directly be updated as well. Pushing code to the repository will trigger a
test-pipeline that runs all tests and checks the code style.

## Packages

walkerOS is separated into multiple packages and developed in a monorepo. The
latest version is under the `develop` branch, while `main` contains the latest
stable and released versions. The whole project can be tested and build using
[TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/repo/). Run all commands from the root
directory.

```bash
# Make sure to install all dependencies first
npm i

# To start a local development server
turbo run dev

# To run all tests
turbo run test

# To build the whole project
turbo run build

# To develop or build a specific package use --filter option
turbo run dev --filter=walker.js
turbo run build --filter=walker.js --filter=utils
```

The `filter` option can be used to only run one or multiple packages. To filter
use the `packages name` field in the `package.json` file.

## Documentation

The documentation is also included in the repository under the `website/docs`
folder. It is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). To start a local
server with live reload make sure to run `npm i` first, go to the `website/`
directory and call:

```bash
npm run start
```

## How to release

How to update a package, create a changeset, and publish a (pre-)release.

#### Making Changes and Creating a Changeset

1. Implement Changes: Make the necessary updates or additions to your packages.

2. Create a Changeset: From the root of your monorepo, run:

```bash
$ npx changeset
```

Select the packages that should be updated and describe the changes.

#### Preparing for (Pre-)Release

1. (Optional) Enter pre-release process:

```bash
$ npx changeset pre enter next
```

2. Bump Version for (Pre-)Release: Now, run:

```bash
$ npx changeset version
```

#### Publishing the Pre-Release

1. Login to npm: Ensure you're logged into npm with `npm login`.

2. To publish with the current tag (`latest` by default or `next` for a
   pre-release): From the root of the monorepo, run:

```bash
$ npm run publish-packages
```

#### (Optional) Exiting Pre-Release Mode

After a pre-release is done and it's ready to be released as a stable version:

1. Exit Pre-Release Mode: Run:

```bash
$ npx changeset pre exit
```

2. Follow the release process again: Create a new changeset for the stable
   release, version, and then publish normally.
