The BigQuery destination allows you to send server-side events from walkerOS to
Google BigQuery. It handles the data transformation and ensures that your events
are correctly formatted for BigQuery tables.

## Dependencies

Before using the BigQuery destination, ensure you have:

- Google Cloud Platform account
- walkerOS Node source installed
- Permissions to write to BigQuery
- Run the setup function to create the table

## Installation

To get started, install the package via npm:

```sh
npm install @elbwalker/destination-node-bigquery
```

## Configuration

Configure the BigQuery destination with your `projectId`.

#### Example

```ts
import { destinationBigQuery } from '@elbwalker/destination-node-bigquery';

await elb('walker destination', destinationBigQuery, {
  custom: {
    projectId: 'PR0J3CT1D', // Required
    // client: BigQuery; // A BigQuery instance from @google-cloud/bigquery
    // datasetId: string; // 'walkerOS' as default
    // tableId: string; // 'events' as default
    // location: string; // 'EU' as default
    // bigquery?: BigQueryOptions; // BigQueryOptions from @google-cloud/bigquery
  },
});
```

## Permissions

When using Service Accounts (SAs) for Google Cloud BigQuery, it's recommended to
follow the principle of _least privilege_. Never grant more permissions than
what it needs to perform its intended functions.

During initial setup, the SA may require broader permissions to create necessary
datasets. Typically, this involves assigning a role like
`roles/bigquery.dataOwner` to the service account. This role can be granted
through Google Cloud IAM.

For production environments, it is recommended to **revoke broader IAM roles**
granted during the setup phase. Assign explicit permissions directly to datasets
within BigQuery (using the share option). This ensures that the service account
only has access to what is necessary for operation. The service account may hold
owner permissions after creating the dataset.
