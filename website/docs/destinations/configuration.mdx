The configuration of a destination is set up in `config`. Call
`elb('walker destination', { push: console.log }, config);` to add the
destination to a source. All properties are optional.

#### Example

```js
{
  id: "demo",
  custom: { foo: "bar" },
  consent: { demo: true },
  init: false,
  loadScript: false,
  mapping: {
    // Read more in the mapping section
    page: {
      view: { name: "pageview" },
    },
    "*": {
      visible: { batch: 2000 },
    },
  },
  policy: {
    'data.gclid': { consent: { marketing: true } },
  },
  queue: true,
  verbose: false,
  onError: (error) => console.error("demo error", error),
  onLog: (message) => console.log("demo log", message),
  on: {
    // Source-related on-events
    consent: [{ marketing: console.log }],
    ready: [console.log],
    run: [console.log],
    session: [console.log],
  },
};

```

## Methods

A source communicates with a destination through **methods**. Its also the
source's job to check for proper consent, calling the `init` method or batching
events. The only required method is `push` to send events to the destination.

### push

The `push` method gets called to send events to the destination, along with the
`config` and eventually `mapping`.

```js
// push function
const push = (event, config, mapping) => {
  config.custom.count++;
  event.data.count = config.custom.count;
  console.log('demo push', { event, config, mapping });
};

// elb("page view");
// Output with the mapping above
// demo log bar
// demo push { event: { data: { count: 1 }, event: 'pageview' }, config: { ... }, mapping: { ... } }
```

### init

`init` is optional and gets called before pushing events. It's used to
eventually load additional scripts or set up the environment. To interrupt
further processing, the method must return `false`.

The walker.js checks the `config.init` value to see if a destination has been
initialized, or not. This way you can add a destination that has already been
initialized.

```js
// Optional init function
const init = (config) => {
  if (config.verbose) config.onLog(config.custom.foo);
  config.custom.count = 0;
};
```

### pushBatch

The `pushBatch` method is optional and gets called if the event `mapping` is
configured with a `batch` number to bundle multiple events before sending them
to the destination.

```js
const pushBatch = (batch, config, instance) => {
  console.log('demo pushBatch', { batch, config });
};
```

The `batch` is an object with the `key` of the used mapping, the `events` array
and the `mapping` object itself.

```js
// Configuring a destinations mapping with
const mapping = {
  '*': {
    visible: { batch: 2000 },
  },
};

// Calling a matching event two times
elb('product visible');
elb('promotion visible');

// The destinations pushBatch receives the following batch after 2 seconds
batch = {
  key: '* visible',
  events: [{ event: 'product visible' }, { event: 'promotion visible' }],
  mapping: { batch: 2000 },
};
```

### on

The `on` method is used to set up rules for on-functions that are triggered by
the source (individually for walker.js and node).

```js
const on = {
  consent: [{ marketing: console.log }],
  ready: [console.log],
  run: [console.log],
  session: [console.log], // walker.js only
};
```

Once a source triggers an event, the destinations `on` method gets called.
Replace the `console.log` with your custom function.

Node destinations in walkerOS offer a flexible and efficient way to handle your
server-side event data. Whether you're sending data to a cloud-based data
warehouse like BigQuery or to a custom API, node destinations make it easy to
configure, initialize, and push your events securely. |

## Functions

### init

Before pushing events to a destination, the node source checks for an available
`init` function and calls it. This asynchronous function returns either `false`
if an error occurs, preventing any events from being processed, or a complete
destination `config` that will be used for pushing events.

### push

The node source calls `await destination.push([{ event, mapping }], config);` to
send events to destinations. This function is executed after checking for proper
consent settings. Events are processed in parallel, and function supports
batching of multiple events. The mapping parameter is optional and allows for
custom event configurations.
