Mapping is used to translate walkerOS events into a required format of another
tool. The mapping also defines how to process events like renaming, bundling, or
ignoring them. It's also checking for consent or validating a value.

There are common event rules for destinations like `name` to rename an event
(e.g. `product add` to `add_to_cart`) or `ignore` to not process an event at
all. There are settings, that are individual for each destination (e.g. a GA4
destination might require a `measurement_id` while a Meta destination requires a
`pixel_id`).

A `*` can be used to match all entities or actions and set up common rules. Each
destination requires specific settings which can be configured in the `custom`
section of the mapping.

```ts
import type { Mapping } from '@elbwalker/types';

const mapping: Mapping.Config = {
  entity: { action: {} }, // Basic structure
  page: {
    view: { name: 'pageview' }, // Rename the event name
    click: { custom: { language: 'globals.language' } }, // Custom settings
    '*': { ignore: true }, // Ignore all other page events
  },
  order: { complete: { consent: { marketing: true } } }, // Require marketing consent
  '*': { visible: { batch: 2000 } }, // Bundle all visible events every 2 seconds
};
```

#### Event

The `Destination.Event` mapping for each event supports standardized default
options. The `custom` option can be used to set up custom properties for the
event and destination's individual settings.

| Property    | Value   | Description                                                              |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **name**    | string  | Renaming of the event (e.g. `product add` to `add_to_cart`)              |
| **ignore**  | boolean | If set to `true` the event won't get pushed to the destination.          |
| **consent** | object  | Required states to process the event.                                    |
| **custom**  | object  | Individual settings for a custom destination.                            |
| **batch**   | number  | Time in ms to bundle the events before calling `pushBatch` if available. |

To disable processing of other events, add `{'*': {'*': { ignore: true }}}` to
the mapping.

:::warning

Make sure to not list duplicate keys in the mapping, since this is an object.
