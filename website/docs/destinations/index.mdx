# Destinations

Destinations are the endpoints where walkerOS sends your processed events. They
transform standardized walkerOS events into the specific formats required by
analytics platforms, marketing tools, data warehouses, and custom APIs.

Destinations handle the final step in the data pipeline by:

* **Format Transformation** - Convert walkerOS events to platform-specific
  formats
* **API Integration** - Handle authentication and delivery to external services
* **Error Handling** - Manage failed requests and retry logic
* **Data Validation** - Ensure events meet destination requirements

All walkerOS destinations export Zod schemas for configuration validation,
providing TypeScript type safety and IDE autocomplete for settings and mapping
options. See the
[Destination Schemas Guide](https://github.com/elbwalker/walkerOS/blob/main/DESTINATION_SCHEMAS.md)
for technical details.

## Architecture

Destinations receive events from the collector after processing:

<FlowMap
  sources={{ default: { highlight: false } }}
  collector={{ highlight: false }}
  destinations={{
    ga4: {
      label: 'Destination',
      text: 'GA4',
      highlight: true,
      after: { label: 'External', text: 'Google Analytics', highlight: false },
    },
    api: {
      label: 'Destination',
      text: 'API',
      highlight: true,
      after: { label: 'External', text: 'Custom Endpoint', highlight: false },
    },
  }}
  markers={[
    { position: 'collector-destination', id: '1', text: 'Receive: Mapped events from collector ready for delivery' },
    { position: 'destination-after', id: '2', text: 'Deliver: Tool-specific API calls, SDK initialization, and event dispatch' },
  ]}
/>

Each destination operates independently, so one failed destination won't affect
others. This ensures reliable data delivery even when individual services have
issues.

## Types of destinations

### Built-in destinations

Platform-agnostic destinations included in the collector:

* **<Link to="/docs/destinations/code">Code</Link>** - Execute custom JavaScript
  for maximum flexibility without external dependencies

### Web destinations

Client-side integrations that send events directly from the browser:

* **<Link to="/docs/destinations/api">API</Link>** - Send events to any HTTP
  endpoint (also available server-side)
* **<Link to="/docs/destinations/web/gtag/">Google Analytics & Ads</Link>** -
  GA4, Google Ads, and GTM integration
* **<Link to="/docs/destinations/web/meta-pixel">Meta Pixel</Link>** - Facebook
  and Instagram advertising
* **<Link to="/docs/destinations/web/plausible">Plausible Analytics</Link>** -
  Privacy-focused web analytics
* **<Link to="/docs/destinations/web/piwikpro">Piwik PRO</Link>** -
  Privacy-focused analytics platform

### Server destinations

Server-side integrations for enhanced privacy and data control:

* **<Link to="/docs/destinations/server/aws">AWS Firehose</Link>** - Amazon
  cloud services integration
* **<Link to="/docs/destinations/server/gcp">BigQuery</Link>** - GCP services
  and BigQuery
* **<Link to="/docs/destinations/server/meta-capi">Meta Conversions
  API</Link>** - Server-side Facebook/Instagram tracking
