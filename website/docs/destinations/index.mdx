# Destinations

Destinations are the endpoints where walkerOS sends your processed events. They
transform standardized walkerOS events into the specific formats required by
analytics platforms, marketing tools, data warehouses, and custom APIs.

Destinations handle the final step in the data pipeline by:

- **Format Transformation** - Convert walkerOS events to platform-specific
  formats
- **API Integration** - Handle authentication and delivery to external services
- **Error Handling** - Manage failed requests and retry logic
- **Data Validation** - Ensure events meet destination requirements

## Architecture

Destinations receive events from the collector after processing:

```
Sources → Collector → Destinations → External Platforms
```

Each destination operates independently, so one failed destination won't affect
others. This ensures reliable data delivery even when individual services have
issues.
