# Destinations

Destinations are the endpoints where walkerOS sends your processed events. They
transform standardized walkerOS events into the specific formats required by
analytics platforms, marketing tools, data warehouses, and custom APIs.

## What They Do

Destinations handle the final step in the data pipeline by:

- **Format Transformation** - Convert walkerOS events to platform-specific
  formats
- **API Integration** - Handle authentication and delivery to external services
- **Error Handling** - Manage failed requests and retry logic
- **Data Validation** - Ensure events meet destination requirements

## Types of Destinations

### Web Destinations

Client-side integrations that send events directly from the browser:

- **<Link to="/docs/destinations/web/gtag/">Google Analytics & Ads</Link>** -
  GA4, Google Ads, and GTM integration
- **<Link to="/docs/destinations/web/meta-pixel">Meta Pixel</Link>** - Facebook
  and Instagram advertising
- **<Link to="/docs/destinations/web/plausible">Plausible Analytics</Link>** -
  Privacy-focused web analytics
- **<Link to="/docs/destinations/web/piwikpro">Piwik PRO</Link>** - Enterprise
  analytics platform
- **<Link to="/docs/destinations/web/api">Custom API</Link>** - Send events to
  your own endpoints

### Server Destinations

Server-side integrations for enhanced privacy and data control:

- **<Link to="/docs/destinations/server/aws">AWS</Link>** - Amazon cloud
  services integration
- **<Link to="/docs/destinations/server/gcp">Google Cloud Platform</Link>** -
  GCP services and BigQuery
- **<Link to="/docs/destinations/server/meta-capi">Meta Conversions
  API</Link>** - Server-side Facebook/Instagram tracking

## Key Benefits

- **Privacy Compliance** - Server-side destinations reduce client-side tracking
- **Data Quality** - Consistent event formatting across all platforms
- **Reliability** - Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Flexibility** - Mix client-side and server-side destinations as needed
- **Consent Awareness** - Automatic respect for user privacy preferences

## Architecture

Destinations receive events from the collector after processing:

```
Sources → Collector → Destinations → External Platforms
```

Each destination operates independently, so one failed destination won't affect
others. This ensures reliable data delivery even when individual services have
issues.

## Getting Started

Choose destinations based on your tracking needs:

1. **Web Analytics** - Start with
   <Link to="/docs/destinations/web/gtag/ga4">Google Analytics 4</Link> or
   <Link to="/docs/destinations/web/plausible">Plausible</Link>
2. **Advertising** - Add <Link to="/docs/destinations/web/meta-pixel">Meta
   Pixel</Link> or <Link to="/docs/destinations/web/gtag/ads">Google Ads</Link>
3. **Custom Data** - Use <Link to="/docs/destinations/web/api">API
   destinations</Link> for your own systems
4. **Enhanced Privacy** - Implement server-side destinations for sensitive data

Each destination includes setup instructions, configuration options, and
examples to help you get started quickly.
