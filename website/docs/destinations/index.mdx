WalkerOS is meant to be **vendor-agnostic**. While clients create events,
destinations are used to manage how events are processed and sent to various
analytics or data storage tools. The purpose of using destinations in walkerOS
is to ensure that data captured from your website or application is
best-organized to easily integrated with different tools if proper consent was
granted. This helps in maintaining data quality and simplifying the setup of new
tools by simply mapping the events to the desired format.

:::info

Destinations initialize and process events **only if a user granted consent**.

:::

## How to use

Destinations are added to a client
(see&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/clients/walkerjs/commands#destinations">web</Link>
or&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/clients/node#adding-destinations">node</Link>). Before
receiving events from the client, the proper consent states are checked each
time automatically. Destinations receive events through the [`push`](#push)
interface. Each destination can have its own configuration, which is set up in
the [`config`](#configuration) object. This configuration includes general
settings for the destination and individual event settings. The optional
[`init`](#init) function in a destination gets called before actually pushing
events. This function must return true upon successful initialization for the
events to be processed.

## Configuration

The configuration of a destination is set up in the `config`. All properties are
optional. A complete destination configuration might look like this:

```js
{
  id: 'demo',
  custom: { foo: 'bar' },
  consent: { demo: true },
  init: false,
  loadScript: false,
  mapping: {
    // Read more in the mapping section
    page: { view: { name: 'pageview' } },
  },
  meta: { name: 'Demo', version: '1.0.0' },
  queue: true,
  verbose: false,
  onError: (error) => console.error('demo error', error),
  onLog: (message) => console.log('demo log', message),
};
```

Overview of all properties:

| Property       | Value    | Description                                                        |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **id**         | string   | A unique key for the destination                                   |
| **consent**    | object   | Required consent states to init and push events                    |
| **custom**     | any      | Used for a destinations individual settings                        |
| **init**       | boolean  | If the destination has been initialized by calling the init method |
| **loadScript** | boolean  | If an additional script to work should be loaded                   |
| **mapping**    | object   | A map to handle events individually                                |
| **meta**       | object   | Additional meta information about the destination                  |
| **queue**      | boolean  | Disable processing of previously pushed events                     |
| **verbose**    | boolean  | Enable verbose logging                                             |
| **onError**    | function | Custom error handler                                               |
| **onLog**      | function | Custom log handler                                                 |

Call `elb('walker destination', { push: console.log }, config);` to add the
destination to a client. The destination will log all events straight to the
console. Edit a destinations configuration at runtime by accessing
`<client>.config.destinations.<id>`.

> To grant required consent call `elb('walker consent', { demo: true });`.

## Mapping

There are common rules for destinations like the renaming of the event name or
the basic rules how to set up the mapping, based on entities and actions
specifically. A `*` can be used to match all entities or actions and set up
common rules. Each destination requires specific settings which can be
configured in the `custom` section of the mapping.

```js
const mapping = {
  entity: { action: {} }, // Basic structure
  page: {
    view: { name: 'pageview' }, // Rename the event name
    scroll: { ignore: true }, // Ignore all other page actions
    click: { custom: { language: 'globals.language' } }, // Custom settings
  },
  // Set custom properties
  order: { complete: { name: 'purchase' } },
  '*': { '*': {} }, // Process all other non-listed events
};
```

Both `name` and `ignore` are standardized options to either rename the event or
ignore it completely. The `custom` object can be used to set up custom
properties for the event.

If a mapping is set up, only the events listed will be processed. To also
process non-listed events, add the `{'*': {'*': {}}}` to the mapping. Make sure
to not list duplicate keys in the mapping.

processing.

## Methods

A client communicates with a destination through the methods. It's also the
clients job to check for proper consent and call the `init` or `setup` methods.

### init

The `init` method is optional and gets called before pushing events. It's used
to eventually load additional scripts or set up the environment. To interrupt
further processing, the method must return `false`.

The walker.js checks the `config.init` value to see if a destination has been
initialized, or not. This way you can add a destination that has already been
initialized.

```js
// Optional init function
const init = (config) => {
  if (config.verbose) config.onLog(config.custom.foo);
  config.custom.count = 0;
};
```

### push

The `push` method gets called to send events to the destination, along with the
`config` and eventually matching `mapping`.

```js
// push function
const push = (event, config, mapping) => {
  config.custom.count++;
  event.data.count = config.custom.count;
  console.log('demo push', { event, config, mapping });
};

// elb("page view");
// Output with the mapping above
// demo log bar
// demo push { event: { data: { count: 1 }, event: 'pageview' }, config: { ... }, mapping: { ... } }
```
