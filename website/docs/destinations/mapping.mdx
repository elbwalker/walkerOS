description: How to transform events into another required format.

import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

The mapping is used to translate events into another required format. It
converts the&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/walkeros/event-model">walkerOS event
model</Link> into another format. The mapping also defines how to process
events, like renaming, bundling, or ignoring them.

There are common rules for destinations like `name` to for renaming an event
(e.g. `product add` to `add_to_cart`) or `ignore` to not process an event at
Each destination requires specific settings which can be configured in the
`custom` section of the mapping.

```js
const mapping = {
  entity: { action: {} }, // Basic structure
  page: {
    view: { name: 'pageview' }, // Rename the event name
    click: { custom: { language: 'globals.language' } }, // Custom settings
  },
  product: {
    visible: { batch: 2000 }, // Bundle all product visible events
  },
  // Set custom properties
  order: { complete: { name: 'purchase' } },
  '*': { '*': { ignore: true } }, // Ignore all other non-listed events
};
```

The `EventConfig` for each event supports standardized default options. The
`custom` option can be used to set up custom properties for the event and
destinations individual settings.

| Property   | Value   | Description                                                              |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **batch**  | number  | Time in ms to bundle the events before calling `pushBatch` if available. |
| **custom** | object  | Individual settings for a custom destination.                            |
| **ignore** | boolean | If set to `true` the event won't get pushed to the destination.          |
| **name**   | string  | Renaming of the event (e.g. `product add` to `add_to_cart`)              |

To disable processing events, add `{'*': {'*': { ignore: true }}}` to the
mapping.

Make sure to not list duplicate keys in the mapping, since this is an object.
