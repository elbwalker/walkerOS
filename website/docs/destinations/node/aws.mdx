## Overview

The AWS Destination package allows you to send events to various AWS services
using walkerOS. Currently, it supports AWS Firehose, with plans to add more
services like SNS, SQS, CloudWatch, and Lambda.

## Installation

To get started, install the package via npm:

```sh
npm install @elbwalker/destination-node-aws
```

## Configuration

Configure the AWS destination with your AWS credentials and settings. Below is
an example configuration:

```js
import destinationAWS from '@elbwalker/destination-node-aws';

const config = {
  firehose: firehoseConfig,
};

elb('walker destination', destinationAWS, config);
```

## Firehose

To configure AWS Firehose, use the following example:

```js
const firehoseConfig = {
  streamName: 'your-firehose-stream-name',
  region: 'eu-central-1', // e.g., 'eu-central-1' for Frankfurt
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: 'your-access-key-id',
    secretAccessKey: 'your-secret-access-key',
  },
};

elb('walker destination', destinationAWS, { firehose: firehoseConfig });
```

### Optional Configuration Fields

- `region`: AWS region where your services are hosted.
- `credentials`: AWS credentials for authentication, containing `accessKeyId`
  and `secretAccessKey`.

## Usage

You can add the destination multiple times, each with one AWS service
configured, or once with all services combined. This flexibility allows you to
use different credentials or handle error handling individually.

### Example

Here is a simple example to demonstrate how to use the AWS destination with
walkerOS:

```js
import destinationAWS from '@elbwalker/destination-node-aws';

const config = {
  firehose: {
    streamName: 'your-firehose-stream-name',
    region: 'eu-central-1',
    credentials: {
      accessKeyId: 'your-access-key-id',
      secretAccessKey: 'your-secret-access-key',
    },
  },
};

elb('walker destination', destinationAWS, config);
```

## Who this package is for

This destination is ideal for data engineers and analysts who are already using
AWS or plan to integrate it into their data stack. It's also useful for
companies looking to centralize their data collection and analysis efforts.

## Permissions

When using AWS credentials, it's recommended to follow the principle of _least
privilege_. Never grant more permissions than what is necessary to perform the
intended functions.

During initial setup, the credentials may require broader permissions to create
necessary resources. For production environments, it is recommended to assign
specific permissions directly to the resources required.

For more detailed information, refer to the official
[AWS IAM documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/).
