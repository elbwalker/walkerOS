Streamline your data collection and analysis by directly sending events from
walkerOS to Google BigQuery. This destination package makes it easy to integrate
your data pipeline with one of the most powerful data warehouses available.

The BigQuery destination allows you to send server-side events from walkerOS to
Google BigQuery. It handles the data transformation and ensures that your events
are correctly formatted for BigQuery tables.
