Streamline your data collection and analysis by directly sending events from
walkerOS to Google BigQuery. This destination package makes it easy to integrate
your data pipeline with one of the most powerful data warehouses available.

The BigQuery destination allows you to send server-side events from walkerOS to
Google BigQuery. It handles the data transformation and ensures that your events
are correctly formatted for BigQuery tables.

## Usage

The BigQuery destination allows you to send server-side events from walkerOS to
Google BigQuery. It handles the data transformation and ensures that your events
are correctly formatted for BigQuery tables.

## Basic example

Here's a simple example to demonstrate how to configure the BigQuery
destination:

```ts
import { destinationBigQuery } from '@elbwalker/destination-node-bigquery';

elb('walker destination', destinationBigQuery, {
  custom: {
    projectId: 'PR0J3CT1D', // Required
    // client: BigQuery; // A BigQuery instance from @google-cloud/bigquery
    // datasetId: string; // 'walkerOS' as default
    // tableId: string; // 'events' as default
    // location: string; // 'EU' as default
    // bigquery?: BigQueryOptions; // BigQueryOptions from @google-cloud/bigquery
  },
});
```

using the custom `bigquery` options.

```ts
{
  custom: {
    projectId: 'PR0J3CT1D', // Required
    bigquery: {

    }
  }
}
```

## Permissions

When using Service Accounts (SAs) for Google Cloud BigQuery, it's recommended to
follow the principle of _least privilege_. Never grant more permissions than
what it needs to perform its intended functions.

During initial setup, the SA may require broader permissions to create necessary
datasets. Typically, this involves assigning a role like
`roles/bigquery.dataOwner` to the service account. This role can be granted
through Google Cloud IAM.

For production environments, it is recommended to **revoke broader IAM roles**
granted during the setup phase. Assign explicit permissions directly to datasets
within BigQuery (using the share option). This ensures that the service account
only has access to what is necessary for operation. The service account may hold
owner permissions after creating the dataset.

For more detailed information, refer to the official
[Google Cloud IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs).

## Who this package is for

This destination is ideal for data engineers and analysts who are already using
Google BigQuery or plan to integrate it into their data stack. It's also useful
for companies looking to centralize their data collection and analysis efforts.

## Dependencies

Before using the BigQuery destination, ensure you have:

- Google Cloud Platform account
- walkerOS Node client installed
- Permissions to write to BigQuery
- Run the setup function to create the table
