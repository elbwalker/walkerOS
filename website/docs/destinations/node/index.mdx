Node destinations in walkerOS offer a flexible and efficient way to handle your
server-side event data. Whether you're sending data to a cloud-based data
warehouse like BigQuery or to a custom API, node destinations make it easy to
configure, initialize, and push your events securely.

## Static Configuration

The static part of the configuration is common across all destinations and is
defined in the `NodeDestination.Config` type. It includes properties like:

- `consent`: Required consent states to process events.
- `id`: A unique key for the destination.
- `init`: Indicates if the destination has been initialized and is ready to
  work.
- `queue`: Option to disable the processing of previously pushed events.

## Custom Configuration

The custom part is specific to each destination and is where you define settings
that are unique to the service you are integrating with. Those destinations
individual configurations are set in the `custom` field, and are defined in the
`Custom` interface.

By structuring the configuration this way, walkerOS provides a flexible yet
standardized way to set up any destination, making it easier to manage and
extend your data pipeline.

## Functions

### init

Before pushing events to a destination, the node source checks for an available
`init` function and calls it. This asynchronous function returns either `false`
if an error occurs, preventing any events from being processed, or a complete
destination `config` that will be used for pushing events.

### push

The node source calls `await destination.push([{ event, mapping }], config);` to
send events to destinations. This function is executed after checking for proper
consent settings. Events are processed in parallel, and the function supports
the batching of multiple events. The mapping parameter is optional and allows
for custom event configurations.
