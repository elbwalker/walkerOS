/>

The BigQuery destination allows you to send server-side events from walkerOS to
Google BigQuery. It handles the data transformation and ensures that your events
are correctly formatted for BigQuery tables.

## Installation

To get started, install the package via npm:

```sh
npm install @walkerOS/server-destination-gcp
```

### Dependencies

Before using the BigQuery destination, ensure you have:

- Google Cloud Platform account
- walkerOS server source installed
- Permissions to write to BigQuery
- Run the setup function to create the table

## Configuration

Configure the BigQuery destination with your `projectId`.

#### Example

```ts
import { destinationBigQuery } from '@walkerOS/server-destination-gcp';

await elb('walker destination', destinationBigQuery, {
  custom: {
    projectId: 'PR0J3CT1D', // Required
    // client: BigQuery; // A BigQuery instance from @google-cloud/bigquery
    // datasetId: string; // 'walkerOS' as default
    // tableId: string; // 'events' as default
    // location: string; // 'EU' as default
    // bigquery?: BigQueryOptions; // BigQueryOptions from @google-cloud/bigquery
  },
  // data: { map: { event: 'event', data: 'data' } }, // Customize the event format
});
```

### Permissions

When using Service Accounts (SAs) for Google Cloud BigQuery, it's recommended to
follow the principle of _least privilege_. Never grant more permissions than
what it needs to perform its intended functions.

During initial setup, the SA may require broader permissions to create necessary
datasets. Typically, this involves assigning a role like
`roles/bigquery.dataOwner` to the service account. This role can be granted
through Google Cloud IAM.

For production environments, it is recommended to **revoke broader IAM roles**
granted during the setup phase. Assign explicit permissions directly to datasets
within BigQuery (using the share option). This ensures that the service account
only has access to what is necessary for operation. The service account may hold
owner permissions after creating the dataset.

For more detailed information, refer to the official
[Google Cloud IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs).

## Schema

By default, the BigQuery destination will use the `WalkerOS.Event` format. It
can be customized using `data` config. Both, array and object fields get
stringified.

### Create table

The destination requires an existing dataset and table to ingest data into. This
schema is used for the default `WalkerOS.Event` format.

Replace `PR0J3CT1D.walkerOS.events` with your actual project ID, dataset, and
table's name. Adjust the options if necessary, and run a query to create it.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `PR0J3CT1D.walkerOS.events` (
  timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  event STRING NOT NULL,
  data JSON,
  context JSON,
  globals JSON,
  custom JSON,
  user JSON,
  nested JSON,
  consent JSON,
  id STRING,
  trigger STRING,
  entity STRING,
  action STRING,
  timing NUMERIC,
  `group` STRING,
  count NUMERIC,
  version JSON,
  source JSON,
  createdAt TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
)
PARTITION BY DATE(timestamp)
OPTIONS (
  description="walkerOS raw events",
  partition_expiration_days=365, -- Automatically delete data older than 1 year
  require_partition_filter=true -- Enforce the use of partition filter in queries
);
```

If you need to create a new dataset, consider to actively enable **physical
storage** billing model to eventually reduce your BigQuery costs. Based on your
events a compression factor of 6 is possible, but may result in higher querying
costs.
