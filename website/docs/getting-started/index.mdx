# What is walkerOS

walkerOS is **event data collection as code**. Capture events from anywhere, transform them with mapping, and route them to any destination—all with built-in consent management.

No fragile UI configs. No vendor lock-in. Just tracking you can version, test, and trust.

## Why walkerOS?

- **Open-Source** — MIT licensed, free forever, no restrictions
- **Self-Hosted** — Your infrastructure, your data, full ownership
- **Config-as-Code** — Version control, PRs, deploy with confidence
- **Composable** — Mix sources, destinations, and mappings freely
- **Developer-First** — TypeScript, no GUI, declarative tagging

---

## How it works

Every walkerOS setup follows one pattern:

```
Sources → Collector → Destinations
└──────────── Flow ────────────┘
```

- **Sources** — Where events come from (browser DOM, dataLayer, HTTP endpoints, custom code)
- **Collector** — The processing engine (consent, enrichment, routing)
- **Destinations** — Where events go (GA4, your API, BigQuery, any service)

A "flow" connects sources to destinations through a collector. You can have one flow or many—client-side, server-side, or both working together.

## The centerpiece: mapping

**Mapping** transforms events between stages. It's how walkerOS adapts to any source or destination format.

```
Raw Input → [SOURCE MAPPING] → walkerOS Event → [DEST MAPPING] → Vendor Format
```

One transformation language works everywhere. This is what makes walkerOS truly composable.

## Two ways to use walkerOS

Both modes use the same architecture. Choose based on how you want to configure and deploy.

### Integrated mode

The collector lives **inside your application code**.

```typescript
import { startFlow } from '@walkeros/collector';
import { sourceBrowser } from '@walkeros/web-source-browser';

const { elb } = await startFlow({
  sources: { browser: { code: sourceBrowser } },
  run: true,
});
```

**Best for:** Building into your app, full TypeScript control, dynamic configuration.

---

### Bundled mode

The collector is a **separate artifact** you configure with JSON.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "flows": {
    "default": {
      "web": {},
      "sources": { "browser": { "package": "@walkeros/web-source-browser" } }
    }
  }
}
```

Then: `walkeros bundle flow.json` → standalone file.

**Best for:** Config-as-code, Docker deployments, separate tracking scripts.
