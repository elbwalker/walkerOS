# Getting started

## Operating modes

walkerOS offers two ways to configure and deploy your event collection. Both use the same underlying architecture—Sources, Collector, Destinations—just packaged differently.

## Integrated mode

The collector lives **inside your application code**.

```typescript
import { startFlow } from '@walkeros/collector';
import { sourceBrowser } from '@walkeros/web-source-browser';

const { elb } = await startFlow({
  sources: { browser: { code: sourceBrowser } },
  run: true
});
```

**Best for:**
- Building walkerOS directly into your app
- Full programmatic control and type safety
- Custom logic and dynamic configuration
- Teams comfortable with TypeScript

## Bundled mode

The collector is a **separate artifact** you configure with JSON and build with the CLI.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "flows": {
    "default": {
      "web": {},
      "sources": { "browser": { "package": "@walkeros/web-source-browser" } }
    }
  }
}
```

Then: `walkeros bundle flow.json` → outputs standalone file.

**Best for:**
- Config-as-code workflows (Git, PRs, CI/CD)
- Independent versioning and deployment
- Teams who prefer JSON over TypeScript
- Docker deployments and server-side collection

[**Get started with bundled mode →**](/docs/getting-started/modes/bundled)

---

## Same core, different packaging

Both modes use identical:
- **Sources** - Browser, DataLayer, HTTP, custom
- **Collector** - Event processing, consent, enrichment
- **Destinations** - GA4, APIs, BigQuery, custom
- **Mapping** - Event transformation rules

The only difference is how you configure and deploy them.

## Choosing your mode

| If you... | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Want full control in TypeScript | [Integrated](/docs/getting-started/modes/integrated) |
| Prefer JSON configuration | [Bundled](/docs/getting-started/modes/bundled) |
| Building a React/Next.js app | [Integrated](/docs/getting-started/modes/integrated) |
| Deploying with Docker | [Bundled](/docs/getting-started/modes/bundled) |
| Need dynamic runtime config | [Integrated](/docs/getting-started/modes/integrated) |
| Want separate tracking script | [Bundled](/docs/getting-started/modes/bundled) |
| Both? | You can use Integrated client-side and Bundled server-side |
