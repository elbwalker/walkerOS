# Quick start

walkerOS is a modular and composable data infrastructure for complete control of
how to collect and process data. The project started as a web library
called&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/sources/walkerjs/">walker.js</Link> and has evolved
into a complete first-party tracking system.

:::note

There are multiple ways to get started. The implemetation depends on
which&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/sources/overview/">source</Link> you want to send
data from and
which&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/destinations/overview/">destination</Link> you want
to send it.

## Prerequisities

Before you start, read about
the&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/walkeros/event-model">event model</Link>
and&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/user_stitching">user stichting</Link>, especially if
you want to work with walkerOS raw data.

## Step 1: Choose a source

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />

## Step 2: Add a destination

<DocCardList />
Conratulations! âœ… You have created your first event pipeline with walkerOS.

## Next steps

Depending on your use-case next steps are different but here is a list with the
most common next steps after the intial setup:

- Start tagging with&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/sources/walkerjs/">walker.js</Link>
- Add more&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/destinations/overview/">destinations</Link>
- Define the&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/destinations/event_mapping">event
  mapping</Link> for your destinations
- Implement&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/consent_management/overview/">consent
  mangement</Link>
- Enhance your data collection and use your
  first&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/utils/overview/">util</Link>
