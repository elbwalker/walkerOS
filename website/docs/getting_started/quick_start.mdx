walkerOS is a modular and composable data infrastructure for complete control
of&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/walkeros/event-model">how to collect</Link> and process
data. It can be used in many ways, using only a
few&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/utils/">Utils</Link> or building
an&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/#complete-infrastructure">extensive setup</Link>. There
is more than one way to work with walkerOS. It's like playing with building
blocks that you build up step by step as you want and need them. The ultimate
goal is to send data to any tool reliably.

To get started, learn about the principles behind creating tracking setups in
general and look at the&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/walkeros/event-model">event
model</Link>. It's based on
an&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/walkeros/event-model#entity-action-approach">entity
action</Link> approach. The project started as a single web library
called&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/sources/walkerjs/">walker.js</Link> and has evolved
into a complete first-party tracking system.

## Collection

### Tracking a website with walker.js

To measure user interaction on a website start by installing walker.js on your
site. By default, all collected events are send to the `dataLayer`. That's it,
you're done. Form now on, all events are now available in Google Tag Manager.

Next step is to
start&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/sources/walkerjs/tagging/">tagging</Link> a website
by adding data-attributes to the HTML. The `data-elb` attributes defines an
**entity** and sets the scope, like `data-elb="promotion"`. Within that scope,
we can define an **action** that gets triggered by user interaction, like
`data-elbaction="click"`. Once a users clicks on that element, a
`promotion click` event will be send to the `dataLayer`. Learn more about
the&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/sources/walkerjs/#basic-idea">basic idea</Link> of
tagging.

## Activating

To&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/sources/walkerjs/commands#destinations">add a
destination</Link> other than the GTM, we can for example log all events also to
the console.

```js
function elb() {
  (window.elbLayer = window.elbLayer || []).push(arguments);
}
elb('walker destination', { push: console.log });
```

There are&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/destinations/web/">pre-built web
destinations</Link> available, but you can
also&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/destinations/web/#create-your-own">build your
own</Link>.
