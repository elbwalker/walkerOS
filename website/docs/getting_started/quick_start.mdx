how to collect and process data. The project started as a web library
called&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/sources/walkerjs/">walker.js</Link> and has evolved
into a complete first-party tracking system.

## Prerequisities

the&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/walkeros/event-model">event model</Link>. It's based on
an entity action approach.
