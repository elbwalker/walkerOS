# Consent Management

Managing user consent is critical for legal compliance and user privacy.
WalkerOS follows a **privacy-by-design** approach and offers multiple ways to
handle consent and manage data processing to ensure the user's privacy is
respected.

:::warning

We don't give any legal advice. Make sure to consult a legal expert to ensure
that your implementation is compliant with the laws and regulations that apply
to your business.

:::

Typically, a Consent Management Platform (CMP) handles the consent. This is an
asynchronous process. The CMP has to be loaded, a user has to make a choice,
and/or the state has to be updated.

To set/update the consent state, the CMP should actively push the
`consent command` with a group or an individual tool's permission state
(`true/false`). If only one condition applies, consent is granted. Updating only
one value won't override existing states.

<CodeBox
  code={`elb('walker consent', { functional: true, marketing: false });
`}
  disabled
  language="javascript"
  label="Code Example"
  showHeader={false}
  autoHeight
/>

Consent keys can be defined arbitrarily (typically known as *functional*,
*analytics*, and *marketing*). However, you can also use individual names for
each vendor.

The walker handles the **race conditions**: Previously pushed events get
processed in the correct order after granting the consent state with the
destinations as well as new ones.

### Destinations

With each event, the consent states get checked. Every event will be added to an
ordered queue if consent isn't granted yet and the destination's queue isn't
disabled. The queue resets with each `walker run` command. And will be
(re-)processed with each `walker consent` update. The key must match the key
used in each `destination.config.consent`.

:::note

The queued events properties `consent`, `globals`, and `user` will be
**updated** to the current state before being processed.

:::

:::note

A destination only requires one granted consent state to process events.

:::

To revoke consent and stop sharing events with a destination, all matching rules
have to be set to `false`:

<CodeBox
  code={`elb('walker consent', { marketing: false });
`}
  disabled
  language="javascript"
  label="Code Example"
  showHeader={false}
  autoHeight
/>

## on Consent

To start walker.js only after a consent choice, use the `on consent` command:

<CodeBox
  code={`// Wait for functional consent to run
elb('walker on', 'consent', {
functional: () => {
elb('walker run');
},
});

// Later, a CMP has to update the consent state
elb('walker consent', { functional: true });
`}
  disabled
  language="javascript"
  label="Code Example"
  showHeader={false}
  autoHeight
/>

Another example of how to use the `on consent` command might be to update
[Googles consent mode v2](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/guides/consent?consentmode=basic):

<CodeBox
  code={`elb('walker on', 'consent', (instance, consent) => {
// Check if marketing consent is granted
if (consent.marketing) {
gtag('consent', 'update', {
ad_user_data: 'granted',
ad_personalization: 'granted',
ad_storage: 'granted',
analytics_storage: 'granted',
});
}
});
`}
  disabled
  language="javascript"
  label="Code Example"
  showHeader={false}
  autoHeight
/>

The consent mode will be updated via `gtag` as soon as marketing consent is
granted.
