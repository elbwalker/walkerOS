Many websites use the `dataLayer` to track events. The dataLayer source can be
used work with this data. Existing and new dataLayer pushes can be processed and
mapped to walkerOS events.

Use the source to integrate single events, migrate a whole existing setup to
walkerOS or to only use the Google Consent Mode configuration.

The dataLayer source intercepts all `dataLayer.pushes` and `gtag` calls. Every
event is cloned and processed in a tryCatch-block to guarantee a stable default
behavior and preventing data mutation.
