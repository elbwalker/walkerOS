# Sources

Sources are the entry points for event data in walkerOS. They capture events
from different environments and formats, then transform them into standardized
events that the collector can process.

## What are Sources?

Sources act as adapters between your application's event-generating components
and the walkerOS collector. Think of them as translators that understand
different "languages" of events and convert them all into a common format that
walkerOS can work with.

## Why Sources Exist

In a typical application, events can come from many different places:

- DOM interactions in the browser (clicks, form submissions, page views)
- DataLayer pushes from other tracking tools
- Server-side events from APIs
- Custom application events

Each of these has its own format and structure. Sources provide a clean
separation between:

- **Event capture** - How events are detected and collected
- **Event processing** - How events are enriched, filtered, and sent to
  destinations

This separation makes walkerOS flexible and maintainable, allowing you to add
new event sources without changing your destination configurations.

## How Sources Work

### Basic Flow

1. **Capture**: Sources listen for or capture events in their native format
2. **Transform**: Convert the captured data into walkerOS event format
3. **Send**: Push the standardized event to the collector for processing

### Integration with walkerOS

Sources integrate seamlessly with the walkerOS architecture:

```typescript
import { createCollector } from '@walkerOS/collector';
import { createSource, sourceBrowser } from '@walkerOS/core';

// Create a collector
const { collector } = await createCollector({
  destinations: {
    /* your destinations */
  },
});

// Add a browser source
const { elb } = await createSource(collector, sourceBrowser, {
  prefix: 'data-elb',
  pageview: true,
});

// The source automatically captures browser events
// and sends them to your collector
```

## Available Sources

### Browser Source

The browser source captures events from web pages:

- **DOM interactions**: Clicks, form submissions, page views
- **Automatic tracking**: Page views, session management
- **Flexible configuration**: Customize what gets tracked and how

### DataLayer Source

The dataLayer source works with existing analytics implementations:

- **Legacy integration**: Works with existing GA4 and dataLayer implementations
- **Event mapping**: Transform dataLayer events to walkerOS format
- **Migration friendly**: Gradual transition from existing setups

## Using Sources

### Basic Setup

Every source follows the same pattern:

1. **Create a collector** with your destination configuration
2. **Add sources** using `createSource` with the source type and configuration
3. **Use the returned `elb` function** to trigger events manually when needed

### Configuration Options

Sources are highly configurable to fit your needs:

- **Enable/disable** sources based on conditions
- **Custom error handling** for robust tracking
- **Source-specific settings** for fine-tuned behavior

### Clean Separation

- Sources handle event capture
- Collector handles event processing
- Destinations handle event delivery

### Flexibility

- Add new sources without changing destinations
- Mix and match different event sources
- Gradual migration from existing tracking setups

### Reliability

- Sources operate independently
- Built-in error handling prevents failures
- Type-safe configuration reduces bugs

### Performance

- Asynchronous initialization
- Efficient event processing
- Proper resource cleanup

## Next Steps

Choose the source that matches your environment:

- **[Browser Source](./web/browser/)** - For web applications and websites
- **[DataLayer Source](./web/dataLayer/)** - For integration with existing
  analytics

Each source includes detailed setup instructions, configuration options, and
usage examples to get you started quickly.
