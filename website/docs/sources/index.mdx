# Sources

Sources are the **entry points** for event data in walkerOS. They capture events
from different environments and formats, then transform them into standardized
events that the collector can process.

In a typical application, events can come from many different places:

- DOM interactions in the browser (clicks, form submissions, page views)
- dataLayer pushes from other tracking tools
- Server-side events from APIs
- Custom application events

Each of these has its own format and structure. Sources provide a clean
separation between:

- **Event capture** - How events are detected and collected
- **Event processing** - How events are enriched, filtered, and sent to
  destinations

This separation makes walkerOS flexible and maintainable, allowing you to add
new event sources without changing your destination configurations.

:::note

walkerOS is primarily build to capture events directly from the browser.

## How sources work

### Basic flow

1. **Capture**: Sources listen for or capture events in their native format
2. **Transform**: Convert the captured data into walkerOS event format
3. **Send**: Push the standardized event to the collector for processing

### Setup within walkerOS

```typescript
import { createCollector } from '@walkeros/collector';
import { createSource, sourceBrowser } from '@walkeros/core';

// Create a collector
const { collector } = await createCollector({
  destinations: {
    /* your destinations */
  },
});

// Add a browser source
const { elb } = await createSource(collector, sourceBrowser, {
  session: true,
  pageview: true,
});

// The source captures browser events and sends them to your collector
```

## Available Sources

### Browser

The browser source captures events from web pages:

- **DOM interactions**: All sorts of user behavior like clicks, form
  submissions, views etc.
- **Automatic tracking**: Page views, session management
- **Flexible configuration**: Customize what gets tracked and how

### dataLayer

The dataLayer source works with existing analytics implementations:

- **Legacy integration**: Works with existing GA4 and dataLayer implementations
- **Event mapping**: Transform dataLayer events to walkerOS format
- **Migration friendly**: Gradual transition from existing setups

## Using Sources

### Basic Setup

Every source follows the same pattern:

1. **Create a collector** with your destination configuration
2. **Add sources** using `createSource` with the source type and configuration
3. **Use the returned `elb` function** to trigger events manually when needed

## Next Steps

Choose the source that matches your environment for more details:

- **[Browser](./web/browser/)** - For web applications and websites
- **[dataLayer](./web/dataLayer/)** - For integration with existing analytics
