The walkerOS node source is build for both, being used in a node app or as part
of a serverless function. It's goal is to capture user events, state management,
and sending data to&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/destinations/node/">node
destinations</Link>.

## Event Lifecycle

1. **Run Initialization**: Similar to a web page view, each run reinitialize the
   source's state.
2. **Event Creation**: Events are formulated and queued internally.
3. **Consent Verification**: Consent is checked before pushing events.
4. **Destination Management**: Events are sent to destinations based on consent
   and configuration settings.
