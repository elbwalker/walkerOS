# Server sources

Server sources accept HTTP requests containing walkerOS events and forward them to the collector. Choose based on your deployment environment.

## Available sources

| Source | Platform | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|
| [Express](./express) | Node.js | Standalone server or existing Express app |
| [Fetch](./fetch) | Edge/Serverless | Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, Deno, Bun |
| [AWS Lambda](./aws) | AWS | API Gateway, Lambda Function URLs |
| [GCP Cloud Functions](./gcp) | Google Cloud | Cloud Functions HTTP triggers |

## Choosing a source

**Express** - Best for traditional Node.js deployments, Docker containers, or when you need full control over the HTTP server.

**Fetch** - Best for edge computing and serverless platforms that support the Web Standard Fetch API.

**AWS Lambda** - Best for AWS-native deployments with API Gateway or Lambda Function URLs.

**GCP Cloud Functions** - Best for Google Cloud deployments using Cloud Functions.

## Common features

All server sources provide:

- **JSON event ingestion** (POST)
- **Pixel tracking** (GET with 1x1 GIF response)
- **CORS support** (configurable)
- **Health checks** (liveness/readiness endpoints)
