Some handy ideas on how to test the setup easily. Start by just looking at the
instance by typing `walkerjs` in the console (or the name used during init).
This will show the current state, including `allowed` if the walker.js has been
started using the `run` command, the `config` object, `destinations`, `queue`
for all events during the current run, and many more.

### Console destination

Add a custom destination where `push` points to console.log to list all events
in the console:

```js
elb('walker destination', { push: console.log });
```

### Test the tagging

Use the `getAllEvents` method to get all events that have been tagged:

```js
walkerjs.getAllEvents();
```

This will log/return an array of all events, including `entity`, `action`,
`trigger`, `data`, `context`, and `nested`.

To get the `globals` use

```js
walkerjs.getGlobals();
```

### elbLayer

Usually, events get pushed to the `window.elbLayer`. You can take a look at the
elbLayer in the console to see events. However, some events might skip the
elbLayer.
