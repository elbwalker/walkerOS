import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';
import PromotionLive from '@site/src/components/templates/promotionLive';

Tag your web components using `data-elb` attributes to enable structured event
tracking — no custom JavaScript required.

By adding a few simple attributes to your markup, you can track user behavior
such as clicks, views, form submissions, and more.

This technique is especially helpful for **component libraries** and **design
systems**, where it is important to **scale** event tagging in a maintainable,
reusable way. You can bake tracking into components once, then use them
everywhere — without extra code or tracking configuration.

You'll learn how to:

- Define entities, actions, and triggers directly in your HTML
- Add contextual and global properties
- Handle dynamic values, arrays, and type casting
- Link elements across DOM boundaries
- Structure nested data automatically

If you're looking for a **lightweight, declarative** way to implement analytics
and event tracking, `data-elb` tagging is your foundation.

## Concept

Tag a page...

{/* <PromotionLive /> */}

```html
<!-- Generic usage -->
<div
  data-elb="ENTITY"
  data-elb-ENTITY="KEY:VALUE"
  data-elbaction="TRIGGER:ACTION"
  data-elbcontext="KEY:VALUE"
  data-elbglobals="KEY:VALUE"
/>

<!-- Example usage -->
<div data-elbglobals="language:en">
  <div data-elbcontext="test:engagement">
    <div data-elb="promotion" data-elbaction="visible:view">
      <h1 data-elb-promotion="name:Setting up tracking easily">
        Setting up tracking easily
      </h1>
      <p data-elb-promotion="category:analytics">Analytics</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

... to get a structured event as a result:

```js
{
  event: 'promotion view', // Name as a combination of entity and action
  data: {
    // Arbitrary properties related to the entity
    name: 'Setting up tracking easily',
    category: 'analytics',
  },
  context: {
    // Provides additional information about the state during the event
    test: ['engagement', 0] // Key, [value, order]
  },
  globals: {
    // General properties that apply to every event
    language: 'en'
  },
  custom: {}, // Additional space for individual setups
  user: {
    // Contains user identifiers for different identification levels
    // Require consent and set manually for sessions building and cross-device
    id: 'us3r1d',
    device: 'c00k131d',
    session: 's3ss10n1d',
  },
  nested: [], // List of nested entities
  consent: { functional: true }, // Status of the granted consent state(s)
  id: '1647261462000-01b5e2-5', // Timestamp, group & count of the event
  trigger: 'visible', // Name of the trigger that fired
  entity: 'promotion', // The entity name involved in the event
  action: 'view', // The specific action performed on the entity
  timestamp: 1647261462000, // Time when the event fired
  timing: 3.14, // Duration how long it took to trigger this event
  group: '01b5e2', // Random identifier for all events during a run
  count: 5, // Incremental counter of the events in the same run
  version: {
    // Information about the used implementation setup
    source: 'X.X.X', // Semantic version of the used source
    tagging: 42, // A version number of the then-used tagging status
  },
  source: {
    // Details about the origin of the event
    type: 'web', // Source type of the event (also app, server, or custom one)
    id: 'https://github.com/elbwalker/walkerOS', // Source of the event's origin
    previous_id: 'https://www.elbwalker.com/' // Previous source (like referrer)
  }
}
```

:::note

You are entirely **free** to define naming conventions.

:::

## Entity & action

You define the entity **scope** by setting the `data-elb` attribute with the
name of an entity to an element, e.g. `data-elb="promotion"`. The default entity
is `page` when no `data-elb` is set.

An **action** can be added by setting the `data-elbaction` attribute on the
**same level** or **child elements** in combination with a **matching trigger**,
e.g., `data-elbaction="visible:view"` to fire a promotion view event when an
element has been in the viewport for at least 50% for one second.

To define the entities' **properties**, set the **composited attribute**
`data-elb-ENTITY` with the key and value, e.g.
`data-elb-promotion="name:tagging is fun;position:overlay"`.

## Triggers

There is a bunch of pre-built triggers. You don't have to deal with event
listener or mutation observer initialization.

| **Trigger** | **Definition**                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| load        | after loading a page when DOM is ready                                               |
| click       | when an element or a child is clicked                                                |
| visible     | after an element has been in the viewport for at least 50% for one second            |
| visibles    | each time an element re-enters the viewport after being out of view                  |
| hover       | each time the mouse enters the corresponding element                                 |
| submit      | on valid form submission                                                             |
| wait(ms)    | waits ms seconds (15 seconds by default) until triggering                            |
| pulse(ms)   | recurring trigger every ms seconds (15 seconds by default) if the page is not hidden |

:::note

Trigger names are predefined and to be selected from the list, while the
`action` can be an arbitrarily defined name.

:::

### Abbreviation

If the trigger and action values are equal, e.g. for click events, you can
shorten the implementation:

```html
<b data-elbaction="click">
  Use the short version, instead of
  <s data-elbaction="click:click">long</s>
</b>
```

### Parameters

Some triggers require more information during initialization, while others
accept optional parameters. The scroll trigger needs to know the percentage a
user scrolls down, a wait trigger the number of milliseconds until the action
gets triggered. Use brackets behind the trigger to pass that information.

```html
<!-- specifying trigger parameters -->
<p data-elbaction="wait(10):interested"></p>
<p data-elbaction="pulse(10):interested"></p>
```

### Action filter

At some point, you might want to nest one entity inside another. To prevent an
action to trigger both entities, you can restrict the action to a specific
entity by adding the name, e.g. `data-elbaction="load:view(product)`. If the
trigger event gets called, the result will only include the property values from
the specific entities.

```html
<!-- setting a filter for an entity -->
<div data-elb="foo">
  <div data-elb="bar" data-elbaction="load:hello(bar)">
    only the bar hello event fires.
  </div>
</div>
```

### Up-bubbling click trigger

By clicking an element, the event bubbles up to the body element. If the walker
finds a `data-elbaction` with the click trigger, it will fire the action. Often,
the image or a whole div-block gets clicked, not the parent a-element. Using the
bubbling-up flow, the walker still triggers the actions for you.

```html
<button data-elb="product" data-elbaction="click">
  <img class="full" src="some.jpg" alt="" />
</button>
```

:::warning

The click trigger uses the bubbling-up process. It will not work with
stopPropagation or preventDefault.

:::

## Linking elements

Use the `data-elblink` tag to extend the scope of an entity by elements placed
somewhere else (like modals). Specific IDs connect linked elements. They are
hierarchically and can either be a parent or a child.

```html
<div data-elb="info" data-elblink="details:parent">...</div>
...
<div data-elblink="details:child" data-elbaction="visible">...</div>
<p data-elblink="another:child">...</p>
```

The second element is the parent, triggering the visible action for the
`info visible` event. There can be multiple children, but there is only one
parent element per ID.

:::note

`data-elb`, `data-elbaction`, `data-elbcontext`, `data-elbglobals`, and
`data-elblink` are reserved attributes, whereas `data-elb-*` attributes may be
arbitrary combinations based on the related entity name. Actions and properties
can be set anywhere inside an elb scope.

:::

:::warning

Spaces in entities, e.g., "shopping cart" or actions, e.g., "add to cart" will
be replaced by underscores to "shopping_cart" and "add_to_cart".

:::

:::tip

Spaces in property values are no problem, e.g. `"category: 'summer sale'"` works
fine. But it is better to set them in quotes when doing so or when using
symbols, especially `:` or `;`

:::

## Data

### Basic attributes

To specify `data`, use the name of the entity. The `data` attributes have to be
inside of the entity scope or a parent.

```html
<div data-elb-entity="source:parent">
  <div data-elb="entity">
    <p data-elb-entity="key:value">...</p>
    <p data-elb-entity="foo:bar">...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
{ data: { source: "parent", key: "value", foo: "bar", } }
```

### Hierarchy

There is a hierarchy for the `data` properties, where the order defines which
values to use for similar keys. Based on the triggering action element, the
closest ones or parent values will be preferred over the others.

```html
<div id="family" data-elb="e" data-elbaction="click">
  <div id="parent" data-elb-e="key:foo" data-elbaction="click">
    <p id="child" data-elb-e="key:bar" data-elbaction="click"></p>
    <b id="sibling" data-elbaction="click"></b>
  </div>
  <b data-elb-e="key:baz"></b>
</div>
```

Based on which element gets clicked, the event will contain the following data

- family: `{ key: 'baz' }`, the last found data-property
- parent: `{ key: 'foo' }`, a direct data-value
- child: `{ key: 'bar' }`, direct value closer than the parent
- sibling: `{ key: 'foo' }`, no value specified, so it takes the parent's value

### Type casting

Property values will be cast to their type, supporting string, number & boolean.

```html
<div data-elb="types">
  <p data-elb-types="string:text">{ string: "text" }</p>
  <p data-elb-types="int:42;float:3.14">{ int: 42, float: 3.14 }</p>
  <p data-elb-types="bool:true">{ bool: true }</p>
</div>
```

### Multiple attributes

Browsers override duplicate attributes. Hence an element can only have one
`data-elb`, `data-elb-ENTITY`, and/or `data-elbaction` attribute at a time.
Nevertheless, it’s possible to define multiple entities, properties, and/or
actions within one attribute using quotes and semicolons. A semicolon splits
key-value pairs. Therefore, it’s necessary to escape values that contain a
semicolon. Quotes are here to meet your needs. To prevent a mistaken
value-split, use single quotes.

```html
<!-- value wrapping with quotes -->
<p data-elb="foo" data-elb-foo="b:a;r">{ "b": "a", "r": true }</p>
<p data-elb="foo" data-elb-foo="b:'a;r'">{ "b": "a;r" }</p>
```

If a single quote is part of the value, escape it with a backslash:

```html
<!-- escaping values with backslash -->
<p data-elb="foo" data-elb-foo="bar:it\'s escaped">{ "bar": "it's escaped" }</p>
```

The semicolon can be used as a separator to list multiple values inside of a
`data-elb` or `data-elbaction` attribute.

```html
<!-- using multiple key-value pairs at once -->
<p data-elb="foo" data-elb-foo="a:1;b:2">{ "a": 1, "b": 2 }</p>
```

### Dynamic field values

You might want to measure dynamic field values, e.g. the quantity of a product
or the value of the selected element. Use a `#` at the beginning, followed by
the attribute name to access the value of the element attribute.

```html
<!-- Basic usage: elb-ENTITY="KEY:#VALUE" -->
<input type="text" value="blue" data-elb-product="color:#value"></input>
<div data-elb-product="name:#innerHTML">Everyday Ruck Snack</div>
```

To capture a selected option from a list, use `elb-ENTITY="KEY:#selected"` to
get size:20L

```html
<select data-elb-product="size:#selected">
  <option value="18L">18L</option>
  <option value="20L" selected="selected">20L</option>
</select>
```

### Arrays

To use array types, add the `[]` suffix to a property's name, such as
`size[]:m`. It will generate de-duplicated data properties.

```html
<div data-elb="product">
  <p data-elb-product="size[]:s;size[]:l"></p>
  <p data-elb-product="size[]:l"></p>
</div>
```

```js
{
  data: {
    size: ["s", "l"],
  },
  // ...
}
```

### Generic properties

Leave the entity name empty (only `data-elb-`) to add the property to any
related entity. Explicitly named properties are preferred over generic ones.

```html
<div data-elb-="p:v">
  <div data-elb="generic">
    <p data-elb-generic="k:v"></p>
    <p data-elb-="g:v"></p>
    <p data-elb-generic="o:v"></p>
    <p data-elb-="o:x"></p>
  </div>
</div>
```

:::note

Explicit properties are preferred over generic ones.

:::

```js
{
  data: {
    p: 'v', // parent
    k: 'v', // explicit
    g: 'v', // generic
    o: 'v' // overridden by explicit
  },
  // ...
}
```

## Globals

There might be properties that don't belong to just one event but to **all
events on a page**. Those properties are called **globals** and will be
**collected once**, right before the first event, got fired. Globals are
arbitrary, like the data property. What is unique about them is that you can
define them anywhere on a page using the `data-elbglobals` attribute.

```html
<div data-elbglobals="outof:scope"></div>

<div data-elb="entity" data-elb-entity="foo:bar" data-elbaction="load:action" />
```

This example will lead to the following event:

```js
{
  "event": "entity action",
  "data": { "foo": "bar" },
  "globals": { "outof": "scope" }
  // other properties omitted
}
```

:::info

For performance reasons, the globals are only collected **once per run**.

:::

## Context

Context doesn't work like globals for every event, but is helpful information
for every framing context an event is embedded in. A context could be a
position, a test, or specific components for example.

```html
<div data-elbcontext="test:engagement" data-elbglobals="plan:paid">
  <div data-elbcontext="recommendation:smart_ai">
    <div
      data-elb="promotion"
      data-elbaction="click"
      data-elb-promotion="title:click me"
    >
      click me
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The context properties are tuples with the value and an index, starting at the
closest parent (`[value, index]`). Access them via `event.context.key[0]`.

```js
{
  event: "promotion click",
  data: { title: "click me" },
  globals: { plan: "paid" },
  context: {
    test: ["engagement", 1],
    recommendation: ["smart_ai", 0],
  },
  // other properties omitted
}
```

:::tip

At elbwalker we often use context for predefined journeys and stages to measure
events along a specific user journey in structured way.

:::

## Nested entities

A `data-elb` entity within another `data-elb` entity is called a **nested
entity**.

The walker algorithm runs through nested entities and treats them like regular
entities by gathering all related information. Nested entities are accessible in
the nested array of each event. Each element is a regular entity.

```html
<div
  data-elb="mother"
  data-elb-mother="label:caring"
  data-elbaction="load:view"
>
  <div data-elb="son" data-elb-son="age:23"></div>
  <div data-elb="daughter" data-elb-daughter="age:32">
    <div data-elb="baby" data-elb-baby="status:infant"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

This example will lead to the following event on load:

```js
{
  "event": "mother view",
  "data": { "label": "caring" },
  "nested": [
    { "type": "son", "data": { "age": 23 } },
    {
      "type": "daughter",
      "data": { "age": 32 },
      "nested": [{ "type": "baby", "data": { "status": "infant" } }],
    },
    { "type": "baby", "data": { "status": "infant" } },
  ],
  // other properties omitted
}
```

Nested entities that are nested inside another entity will be captured on both
levels.

:::note

Nested entities are not available for auto-captured page view events.
