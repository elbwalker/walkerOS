# CMP sources

walkerOS provides ready-made source packages for popular Consent Management
Platforms. Each source listens for CMP events and automatically calls
`elb('walker consent', state)` — no manual event listener code needed.

| CMP | Package |
| --- | ------- |
| [CookieFirst](/docs/sources/web/cmps/cookiefirst) | `@walkeros/web-source-cmp-cookiefirst` |
| [CookiePro / OneTrust](/docs/sources/web/cmps/cookiepro) | `@walkeros/web-source-cmp-cookiepro` |
| [Usercentrics](/docs/sources/web/cmps/usercentrics) | `@walkeros/web-source-cmp-usercentrics` |

## How it works

Typically, a Consent Management Platform (CMP) handles user consent. This is an
asynchronous process: the CMP has to load, the user makes a choice, and the
consent state is updated. CMP sources handle this automatically by:

1. Detecting if the CMP is already loaded and reading existing consent
2. Listening for CMP-specific events on consent changes
3. Mapping CMP categories to walkerOS consent groups via `categoryMap`
4. Calling `elb('walker consent', state)` with the mapped state

All CMP sources support `explicitOnly` (default: `true`) to filter out
implicit/default consent and only process active user choices.

For more details on how consent works in walkerOS, see the
[consent management guide](/docs/guides/consent).
