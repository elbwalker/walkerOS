# Stacks

Stacks in walkerOS are server-side packages to operate an own custom endpoint
for data-ingestion. Collecting data from different sources and processing them
in an own environment enables companies to enhance data integrity and quality by
validating, enhancing and redacting data. It also helps complying with privacy
standards. Companies benefit from using stacks by maintaining controll over
their data processing before integrating other tools.

## Use Cases

- **Data Validation**: Ensures that the data being collected adheres to
  predefined data contracts, enhancing data quality and reliability.
- **Data Enrichment**: Allows for the addition of extra data or context to the
  collected data, which can be pivotal for deeper insights and more effective
  data analysis.
- **Data Redaction**: Crucial for compliance with privacy laws and regulations,
  as it enables the removal or obfuscation of sensitive information before data
  storage or analysis.
