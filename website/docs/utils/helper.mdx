These helper utils are a collection of useful functions used by walkerOS. They
can be used as standardtized building blocks for custom setups. Learn how to
install and use them in the&nbsp;<Link to="../utils#installation">Utils
installation</Link> section.

Utils are grouped into&nbsp;<Link to="#core">Core</Link> and
&nbsp;<Link to="#web">Web</Link> functions. While the core-helpers can be used
in any environment, the web-helpers are are made for the browser.

## Core

### assign

`assign<T>(target: T, source: Object = {}): T` function merges two objects into
a single one. It has a special behavior for array properties: when merging, it
concatenates arrays from both the source and target objects, removing duplicate
items in the process. This function is particularly useful for combining objects
with complex structures, including nested arrays, ensuring that array data is
effectively integrated without redundancy.

```js
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: [1, 2] };
const obj2 = { b: [2, 3], c: 3 };
assign(obj1, obj2); // Returns { a: 1, b: [1, 2, 3], c: 3 }
```

Use `assign` to merge configurations or state-objects or events, particularly
when dealing with array properties that should be concatenated without
duplicates.

### castValue

`castValue(value: unknown): WalkerOS.PropertyType` function converts string
values to their respective data types like number or boolean. This is useful
when dealing with values that are inherently strings, such as those from query
parameters or data-attributes, and need to be utilized in their correct data
type.

```js
const num = castValue('123'); // Converts to 123 (number)
const bool = castValue('true'); // Converts to true (boolean)
```

The function simplifies the process of data type conversion, ensuring that
string inputs are appropriately processed for further use in various logic
flows.

### getByStringDot

`getByStringDot(event: unknown, key: string, i=0): unknown` allows accessing
properties in an object with a string path. It supports using a wildcard `_` to
iterate through array elements. If the specified path does not exist, the
function returns undefined, ensuring safe access to nested properties.

```js
getByStringDot({ data: { id: 'wow' } }, 'data.id');
// Returns "wow"
```

Use the wildcard character `_` and `i` for dynamic access on arrays, like
`"nested._.id"`

```js
getByStringDot({ nested: [1, 2, { id: 'impressive' }] }, 'nested._.id', 2);
// Returns 'impressive'
```

It's created to access values from an event by using the string-dot notation.

### getId

`getId(length=6): string` function generates a random alphanumeric string of a
specified length.

```js
getId(); // Returns a random string, e.g., 'a1b2c3'
getId(10); // Returns a random string of 10 characters, e.g., 'a1b2c3d4e5'
```

This function is particularly useful for scenarios where unique identifiers are
needed, such as dynamically generated element IDs, unique keys for list items in
rendering, or temporary identifiers.

### getMarketingParameters

`getMarketingParameters(url: string, custom={}): WalkerOS.Properties` extracts
marketing-related parameters, such as UTM parameters, from URLs. This is useful
in scenarios where you need to analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns
by identifying sources, mediums, campaigns, etc., from the URL query parameters.

```js
getMarketingParameters('https://localhost/?utm_source=docs&gclid=xxx');
// Returns { source: "docs", clickId: "xxx" }

getMarketingParameters('https://example.com/?utm_custom=value', {
  utm_custom: 'custom',
});
// Returns { custom: 'value' }
```

Add `custom` parameters to parse more values from the url like `?utm_custom=123`
with `{ utm_custom: "custom" }` to get `{ custom: "123" }`.

This function facilitates the easy retrieval of marketing data, aiding in
campaign tracking and analysis.

### Invocations

The `debounce` and `throttle` functions are both ways to batch invocations,
designed to optimize function execution frequency. They're used for performance
optimizations or cost reduction, these functions create batches of previously
individual calls in two different ways.

#### debounce

`debounce(fn: Function, wait=1000)` delays a function's execution until a
specified time has elapsed since the last time it was invoked. This is ideal for
use cases like search input handling, where you don't want the function to fire
on every keystroke.

```js
debounce(console.log)('called'); // Executes only after 1000ms of inactivity

const debouncedLog = debounce(() => console.log('Debounced'), 500);
debouncedLog(); // Executes only after 500ms of inactivity
```

#### throttle

Limits the execution of a function to no more than once every specified number
of milliseconds. It's beneficial for situations like scroll events where you
want to limit how often an event handler is called.

```js
const throttledLog = throttle(() => console.log('Throttled'), 500);
throttledLog(); // Executes at most every 500ms
```

### isSameType

`isSameType<T>(variable: unknown, type: T): variable is typeof type` checks if
two provided values are of the same data type. This function is essential in
scenarios requiring type validation, ensuring consistency and preventing errors
due to type mismatches.

```js
isSameType(10, 20); // Returns true (both are numbers)
isSameType('hello', 5); // Returns false (different types)
```

This function helps in validating inputs, comparing variables, and ensuring data
integrity by verifying that operations are performed on matching data types.

### onLog

`onLog(message: string, level: string)` is a function designed for consistent
and customizable logging across your application. It allows you to log messages
with with a verbose option, aiding in better monitoring and debugging of your
code.

```js
onLog('Silent'); // Won't log anything
onLog('Curious', true); // Logs a message
```

This function is for maintaining a standardized logging format is crucial. I

### sessionStart

the&nbsp;<Link to="./session">Session</Link> page.

### Storage

As this is are more complex utils learn more about them on
the&nbsp;<Link to="./storage">Storage</Link> page.

### throwError

`throwError(message: string)` is used to throw custom errors with a specific
message. It's particularly useful in scenarios where standard error handling
needs to be customized or more descriptive error messages are required for
debugging.

```js
throwError('Broken'); // Throws an error with the message 'Broken'
```

This function enhances error management by allowing you to provide clear,
context-specific error messages, aiding in the debugging process and improving
code maintainability.

### trim

`trim(str: string): string` is designed to remove whitespace from both ends of a
string. This is useful for cleaning up user input or values from
data-attributes.

```js
trim('  Moin  '); // Returns 'Moin' without leading or trailing spaces
```

Using trim ensures that strings are processed in a consistent format, which is
essential for accurate data handling and user input validation.

### try-catch

These functions are ideal to ensure that the application remains robust and
error-free, especially when dealing with uncertain or risky operations. By
providing a fallback mechanism, `tryCatch` and `tryCatchAsync` enhances the
stability and reliability of code.

#### tryCatch

`tryCatch(tryFn: Function, catchFn: Function)` is a higher-order function
designed to handle errors gracefully in JavaScript. It takes two functions as
arguments: tryFn, which is the function to be executed, and catchFn, which is
the function to be executed if tryFn throws an error.

```js
const safeParse = tryCatch(JSON.parse, () => ({}));
safeParse('{"valid": "json"}'); // Successfully parses JSON
safeParse('invalid json'); // Returns {} instead of throwing an error
```

#### tryCatchAsync

`tryCatchAsync(tryFn: Function, catchFn: Function)` is similar to tryCatch but
tailored for asynchronous operations. It wraps an async function (tryFn) and a
fallback (catchFn) for handling errors in async processes.

```js
const safeCall = tryCatchAsync(
  () => asyncFnThatMightFail(),
  () => ({ error: 'Bad luck' }),
);
safeCall().then(console.log);
```

This function ensures your async operations are robust, providing a way to
handle errors gracefully without disrupting the application flow.

### useHooks

As this is a more complex util learn more about it on
the&nbsp;<Link to="./hooks">Hooks</Link> page.

## Web

### getAttribute

`getAttribute(element: HTMLElement, attribute: string): string` is designed for
retrieving the value of a specified attribute from a given DOM element. This
utility is especially handy when you need to extract data dynamically from
elements on a webpage, such as reading data attributes, class names, or IDs.

```js
const element = document.body;
const value = getAttribute(element, 'data-elb');
// Retrieves the value of 'data-elb' from the documents body
```

This function simplifies the process of interacting with the DOM by providing an
easy and direct way to access element attributes.

### isVisible

`isVisible(element: HTMLElement): boolean` checks if a given HTML element is
visible on the page from a users perspective.

```js
isVisible(document.getElementById('promotion'));
// Returns true if 'promotion' is visible
```
