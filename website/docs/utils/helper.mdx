title: Helper
---

A collection of helpful functions for easier and privacy-friendly tracking
setups

All util-functions are available through the npm package (@elbwalker/walker.js).
They are not bundled for direct access in the browser version of walker.js to
reduce file size. To use them you can import them.

## Invocations

To optimize the number of executions for e.g. performance optimizations or cost
reduction, these functions could help.

### debounce

Grouping multiple calls in a single invocation after a specific wait time.

```js
import { debounce } from '@elbwalker/walker.js';

// debounce(fn, wait=1000)
debounce(console.log)('called');
```

### throttle

Limit the number of invocations within a delay time.

```js
import { throttle } from '@elbwalker/walker.js';

// throttle(fn, delay=1000)
throttle(console.log)('called');
```

## Stuff

Why not? They might be useful in any way.

### getByStringDot(event, key, i)

Access values from event by using the string-dot notation. Use the key
`"data.id"` on `event: { data: { id: "wow" } }` to get the value `wow`.

Use the wildcard character _ and i for dynamic access, like `"nested._.id"`on`{
nested: [ 1, 2, { id: "impressive" } ] }`to get`impressive`.

The return type is unknown and will be `undefined` if the key doesn't exist.

### isVisible(element)

Used to check if an element is visible to the user.

```js
import { isVisible } from '@elbwalker/walker.js';

// isVisible(element: HTMLElement): boolean
isVisible(document.body) === true;
```
