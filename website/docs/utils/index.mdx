Utils are re-usable functions to standardize and simplify tracking setups. Utils
vary from simple&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/utils/helper">helper</Link> functions to
more complex ones for&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/utils/session">session
handling</Link>. They are used in walkerOS itself and can be used in custom
tracking setups as well.

Simple functions are grouped on
the&nbsp;<Link to="/docs/utils/helper">helper</Link> page, more complex ones
have their own pages.
