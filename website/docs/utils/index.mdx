  A collection of helpful functions for easier and privacy-friendly tracking
  setups

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Utils are re-usable functions to standardize and simplify tracking setups. They
vary from simple functions like&nbsp;<Link to="helper/#getId">`getId`</Link> to
more complex ones like&nbsp;<Link to="session">`sessionStart`</Link>. They are
used in walkerOS itself and can be used in custom tracking setups as well.

Simple functions are grouped on the&nbsp;<Link to="helper">Helper</Link> page,
more complex ones have their own pages.

## Installation

There are multiple ways to install and use the utils.

### NPM

```bash
npm install @elbwalker/utils
```

### CDN

There are multiple build files available. Bundled with all functions, grouped
only for the core or web, and separated into individual files. The `es5` files
can be used in older browsers as well as the GTM.

    Load the `.mjs` module-file directly from the CDN or your own server.
