# Storage

To persist data on a device the storage utils can be used to work with either
`localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or `cookie` to write, read and delete values.
Use `cookies` as a stage location when values should also be transmitted with
each request. `localStorage` can be used to persist data for a longer period and
across all the browser's tabs. As a volatile memory for one specific task, the
`sessionStorage` can be a good choice in terms of short-term persistence, where
data is only available in one tab.

Following a privacy-by-design approach, storage utils have an in-build max-age
functionality, to specify the maximum lifetime of a value. The default is set to
30 minutes. While cookies get deleted automatically by a browser, this doesn't
apply to localStorage and sessionStorage.

Values are written as JSON strings in the format of
`{ e: 1525779420000, v: "value"}` where `e` is the expiration date and `v` is
the value. The `storageRead` function checks if the expiration date is still
valid and will eventually delete an expired entry and return `''` in both cases.

Accessing and working with all storage types might require consent.

### storageWrite

Used to write a `value` to a `key` in a `storage` that can be either `local`,
`session` (default) or `cookie`. With `maxAgeInMinutes` an expiration date can
be set. The `domain` is only required when using `cookie` as a storage type.

```js
// storageWrite(key, value, maxAgeInMinutes=30, storage='session', domain): WalkerOS.PropertyType

// Write elbUserId us3r1d to the localStorage, valid for 60 min and automatically
// returns the value 'us3r1d' using storageRead.
storageWrite('elbSessionId', 'us3r1d', 60, 'local');
```

### storageRead

Accessing the `elbUserId` from a `storage` with an in-build max-age check that
eventually deletes an expired entry and returns either the `value` or `''`.

```js
// storageRead(key, storage='session'): Walker.PropertyType

// Read the elbUserId from localStorage
storageRead('elbUserId', 'local');
```

### storageDelete

Used to delete a `key` from a `storage`.

```js
// storageDelete(key, storage='session'): void

// Delete the elbUserId from localStorage
storageDelete('elbUserId', 'local');
```
