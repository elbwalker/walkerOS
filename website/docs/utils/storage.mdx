# Storage

To persist data on a device there are three common ways to write, read and
delete values. Use cookies as a stage location when values should also be
transmitted with each request. The localStorage can be used to persist data for
a longer period and across all the browser's tabs. As a volatile memory for one
specific task, the sessionStorage can be a good choice in terms of short-term
persistence, where data is only available in one tab.

Following a privacy-by-design approach, the storage utils have an in-build
max-age functionality, to specify the maximum lifetime of a value. The default
is set to 30 minutes. While cookies get deleted automatically by a browser, this
doesn't apply to localStorage and sessionStorage.

:::note[Info] Not all data will be deleted automatically. But using the
[storageRead](###storageRead) function will do a check and eventually removes a
value if it's no longer valid. :::

### storageWrite

```js
import { storageWrite } from '@elbwalker/walker.js';

// storageWrite(key, value, maxAgeInMinutes, storage, domain): void
// Write elbUserId to localStorage, valid for 60 min
// and returns the value using storageRead
storageWrite('elbUserId', 'us3r1d', 60, 2);
```

### storageRead

```js
import { storageRead } from '@elbwalker/walker.js';

// storageRead(key, storage): Walker.PropertyType
// Read the elbUserId from localStorage, returns '' if not available or invalid
storageRead('elbUserId', 2);
```

### storageDelete

```js
import { storageDelete } from '@elbwalker/walker.js';

// storageDelete(key, storage): void
// Delete the elbUserId from localStorage
storageDelete('elbUserId', 2);
```
