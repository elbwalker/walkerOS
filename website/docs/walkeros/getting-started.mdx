walkerOS is a modular and composable data infrastructure for complete control
of&nbsp;<Link to="event-model">how to collect</Link> and process data. It can be
used in many ways, using only a few&nbsp;<Link to="../utils">Utils</Link> or
building an&nbsp;<Link to="../#complete-infrastructure">extensive setup</Link>.
There is more than one way to work with walkerOS. It's like playing with bricks
built step-by-step as you like and need it. The ultimate goal is to send data to
any tool reliably.

To get started, learn about the principles behind creating tracking setups in
general and look at the&nbsp;<Link to="event-model">event model</Link>. It's
based on an&nbsp;<Link to="event-model#entity-action-approach">entity
action</Link> approach. The project started as a single web library
called&nbsp;<Link to="../clients/walkerjs">walker.js</Link> and has evolved into
a complete first-party tracking system.

## Collection

### Tracking a website with walker.js

To measure user interaction on a website start by installing walker.js on your
site. By default, all collected events are send to the `dataLayer`. That's it,
you're done. Form now on, all events are now available in Google Tag Manager.

Next step is to start&nbsp;<Link to="../clients/web/tagging/">tagging</Link> a
website by adding data-attributes to the HTML. The `data-elb` attributes defines
an **entity** and sets the scope, like `data-elb="promotion"`. Within that
scope, we can define an **action** that gets triggered by user interaction, like
`data-elbaction="click"`. Once a users clicks on that element, a
`promotion click` event will be send to the `dataLayer`. Learn more about
the&nbsp;<Link to="../clients/walkerjs/#basic-idea">basic idea</Link> of
tagging.

To&nbsp;<Link to="../clients/walkerjs/commands#destinations">add a
destination</Link> other than the GTM, we can for example log all events also to
the console.

```js
function elb() {
  (window.elbLayer = window.elbLayer || []).push(arguments);
}
elb('walker destination', { push: console.log });
```

There are&nbsp;<Link to="../destinations/web/">pre-built web destinations</Link>
available, but you can
also&nbsp;<Link to="../destinations/web/#create-your-own">build your own</Link>.
