# walkerOS

Every business is individual, and so are their data needs. Data foundations grow
and adapt to those needs over time. Evolving requirements often result in
tremendous communication and implementation effort, (accidental) user privacy
violations, and a growing dependence on a single analytics provider.

Designed as a unified and privacy-centric data collection platform, walkerOS
creates the single source of truth for data teams.

It seamlessly integrates with various analysis and storage tools, bringing
together various roles like Data Engineers, Analysts, Product Owners, Growth
Marketers, and Developers with their individual needs.

Key features include data quality enforcement, built-in consent management, data
redaction capabilities, first-party data collection, and support for server-side
and client-side event tracking.

disrupting existing setups.
