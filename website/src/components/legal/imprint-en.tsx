            <b>Liability for links</b>
            <br />
            Our offer contains links to external third-party websites over whose
            content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot accept any
            liability for this third-party content. The respective provider or
            operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the
            linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
            violations at the time they were linked. No illegal content was
            found at the time the link was created. A permanent control of the
            content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete
            evidence of a violation of the law. As soon as we become aware of
            legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
          </p>

            <b>Liability for content</b>
            <br />
            As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on
            these pages in accordance with general law in accordance with
            Section 7 (1) of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). According to
            &sect;&sect; 8 to 10 TMG, as a service provider, we are not obliged
            to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to
            investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
            Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to
            general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is
            only possible from the point in time at which we become aware of a
            specific legal violation. As soon as we become aware of such legal
            violations, we will remove this content immediately.
