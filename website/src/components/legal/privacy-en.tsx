            <h4 className="text-gray-50">1. Scope of processing</h4>
            <p>
              We only collect and use personal data insofar as this is necessary
              for the provision of a functional website and our content and
              services, you have given your consent or the processing of the
              data is permitted by a legal regulation.
            </p>
            <h4 className="text-gray-50">
              2. Legal basis for processing personal data
            </h4>
            <p>
              Insofar as we obtain your consent for the processing of personal
              data, Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the
              processing of personal data. When processing personal data that is
              necessary to fulfill a contract to which you are a party, Article
              6 (1) (b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to
              processing operations that are necessary to carry out
              pre-contractual measures. If the processing of personal data is
              necessary to fulfill a legal obligation to which our company is
              subject, Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR serves as the legal basis. If it
              is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or
              a third party and if your interests, fundamental rights and
              freedoms do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, Article 6
              (1) (f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.
            </p>
            <h4 className="text-gray-50">
              3. Legitimate interests in processing
            </h4>
            <p>
              If the processing of your personal data is based on Article 6 (1)
              (f) GDPR, our legitimate interest, unless otherwise stated, is the
              conduct of our business activities. In addition, we have indicated
              our purposes and interests in the context of the above list of
              processing.
            </p>
            <h4 className="text-gray-50">
              4. Data deletion and storage duration
            </h4>
            <p>
              Your personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the
              purpose of storage no longer applies or you revoke your consent.
              Storage can also take place if this has been provided for by the
              European or national legislator in Union regulations, laws or
              other provisions to which the person responsible is subject. If
              the storage purpose no longer applies, if you revoke your consent
              or if a storage period prescribed by the European directives and
              ordinances or another responsible legislator expires, the personal
              data will be routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the
              statutory provisions, unless there is a need for further storage
              the data exists for the conclusion or fulfillment of a contract.

              5. Recipient of the data collected / data transmission
            </h4>
            <p>
              We as the responsible company are primarily the recipients of the
              data collected via our website. In addition, processors (web
              hosts, IT service providers, etc.) may have access to the data
              collected via our website. However, compliance with the legal
              regulations is guaranteed by order processing contracts that we
              conclude with our order processors based in the EU. Data is only
              transferred to so-called third countries outside the EU if and to
              the extent that this is indicated below.

              We use comprehensive technical and organizational measures to
              secure our website and other systems against loss, destruction,
              access, modification or dissemination of your data by unauthorized
              persons. These measures are subject to constant review and
              improvement in order to ensure that the technology is up to date.

                services
              </h4>
              <p>
                You have the option to register on our website. When you create
                a user account or register, you must provide certain mandatory
                information in order to gain access to your user account and
                manage it (“mandatory information”). Mandatory information as
                part of the registration is marked with an asterisk and is
                required for the conclusion of the user contract. Which data is
                collected can be seen from the respective input forms. As part
                of the registration, these are: Your name and your e-mail
                address. You also need to create a password. If you do not
                provide this information, you will not be able to create a user
                account. In addition, you can voluntarily provide information
                about your job title / department and company name during
                registration. The legal basis for the processing of your data is
                the fulfillment of our contract with you in accordance with Art.
                6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR. We use the data you have provided to
                authenticate you when you log in and to follow up requests to
                reset your password, to verify your authorization to manage the
                user account, to enforce the terms of use of the website and all
                associated rights and obligations and to be in contact with you
                in order to be able to send you technical or legal notices,
                updates, security notifications or other messages relating to
                the administration of the user account. We therefore only use
                the data you have provided to process the contract and to
                provide our services to be provided within the framework of the
                contract. We can also pass on your data to one or more
                processors who also use your data exclusively for internal use
                on our behalf. When using our services, we also use the data you
                provided when registering. The legal basis for the processing of
                your data is the fulfillment of our contract with you in
                accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                A transfer of this data to third parties does not take place
                unless there is a legal obligation to transfer or the transfer
                is used for criminal prosecution.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the contract has been fully processed or your account has
                been deleted, your data will initially be blocked for further
                use and deleted after the statutory retention periods have
                expired, unless you have expressly consented to further use of
                your data or we reserve the right to use data beyond this, which
                is legally permitted and about which we will inform you below.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can object to processing at any time and delete your
                account. In such a case, the contractual relationship with you
                cannot be continued.

                this purpose, the provider of the social network usually saves
                cookies on your device, in which your usage behavior and your

                system from which you are visiting it - for example your IP
                address, the type of processor and browser version used,
                including plugins.

                If you are logged in with your personal user account of the
                respective network while visiting such a network, this network
                can assign the visit to your account. If you do not want such an
                assignment, you must log out of your account before visiting our
                social media presence and delete the cookies.

                processing of the respective social network provider, the legal
                basis for the processing of your data is Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR.

                <p>
                  In order to be able to understand which contents of our
                  website are interesting for users, we integrate the "Walker"
                  from elbwalker GmbH, Gerhofstraße 1-3, 20354 Hamburg. The
                  Walker is a tool with which we can, for example, understand
                  which buttons are clicked on our website and which offers on
                  our website are being used. In order to be able to track
                  corresponding usage activities on our website, elbwalker
                  collects the IP address of the user without setting cookies or
                  having them set, and initially without having activated
                  tracking, and sends this to a service from Amazon Web Services
                  (AWS) Inc., 410 Terry Avenue North Seattle WA 09109, USA,
                  hosted in Frankfurt, Germany for shortening and thus
                  anonymization. The transfer of the IP address to AWS takes
                  place only in individual cases and on the basis of an data
                  processing contract concluded with AWS and in accordance with
                  standard contractual clauses agreed with AWS and other
                  security measures approved by the GDPR that ensure the
                  security of the processing of personal data with a level of
                  protection identical to that in the EU. After receiving the
                  shortened IP address from AWS, the walker is activated and the
                  activities of this shortened IP address are tracked without
                  personal reference. These usage activities are shown to us in
                  the context of anonymous statistics in which a personal
                  reference to a single user is not possible. You can find more
                  information about elbwalker on this website www.elbwalker.com.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A personal reference can, for example, only take place under
                  special technical conditions, namely when the date, time and
                  activity of an abbreviated IP address are simultaneously
                  considered in combination with, for example, an order for
                  goods or services by a user on our website at the specified
                  time and time. However, even this combination usually has to
                  be made by combining data from different systems for which
                  only different people may be authorized to access.

                <p>
                  The processing of personal data in the aforementioned manner
                  and for the aforementioned purpose follows our legitimate
                  interest, as we track usage activities and usage statistics to
                  improve the offers and content on our website with the
                  greatest possible protection of personal data and without the
